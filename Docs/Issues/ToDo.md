 would like to access a generated markdown page of the Timeline, FAQ, Study Guide and Briefing doc.  and pin that and be able to send it out to people rather the the full notebook, a '.md' file.

A way to generate that on the fly would be a really on-brand feature. that could promote collaboration and quick prototyping and discussion within the human groups using NotebookLM.
```

``````
Proposal:
I'd like to suggest adding a third button/section, perhaps called "Subscriptions" or "Watchlist".

How it would work:
In this section, users could add links to:

    RSS feeds
    YouTube playlists
    Entire YouTube channels


NotebookLM would then periodically check these sources for new content (new RSS posts, new videos). The "Subscriptions" section would display a list of the latest items from the added feeds/channels. Users could then easily review this list and select (accept or decline) the items they want to import as new sources into their notebook.

Benefits:

    Automation: Makes it easier to track regularly updated sources (like news, industry blogs, video tutorial series).
    Efficiency: Instead of manually searching for and adding each new article/video, we'd have a quick way to select and import relevant updates.
    Up-to-dateness: Helps keep notebooks powered by the latest information from the channels we follow.



# Executive Summary: Phase 2 Plan for Sync System

After the initial local-first SQLite deployment, the next critical steps for scaling are: (1) enforce **server-assigned timestamps** to eliminate clock drift issues, (2) persist **deferred link operations** across sessions for robustness, (3) implement **client acknowledgment tracking and garbage collection** for `sync_log` growth control, (4) prepare for a **Postgres backend** with Row-Level Security for multi-tenant support, and (5) enhance **metrics and observability**.  
**Timing:** These upgrades must begin before expanding beyond ~20 devices or any production multi-user environment to avoid costly retrofitting.

Here’s a **clean, forward-looking "Phase 2 Growth Plan" memo** you can use internally or forward to leadership:

---

# Phase 2: Growth Plan for Synchronization System  
**(Post-Initial SQLite Deployment)**

## Objective:
Ensure that the synchronization architecture, originally designed for small teams and single-device use cases, can **scale safely and predictably** to multi-user, multi-device, and eventually multi-tenant environments.

---

## Key Focus Areas:

1. **Server-Authoritative Timestamps**  
   Transition from trusting client-generated `last_modified` timestamps to **server-assigned timestamps** during sync ingestion.  
   - Required to eliminate inconsistencies caused by client clock drift.
   - Impacts conflict resolution logic (LWW becomes truly canonical).

2. **Persistent Deferred Queue for Links**  
   Refactor deferred link/unlink operations (`MediaKeywords`) to **persist across sessions**.  
   - Deferred changes must survive application crashes, network failures, or sync retries.
   - Design persistent "deferred queue" table or mechanism.

3. **`sync_log` Garbage Collection Mechanism**  
   Implement **client acknowledgment** tracking and **safe vacuuming** of old `sync_log` entries.
   - Prevent unbounded database growth.
   - Server must track per-client sync state (last change_id or last_modified).
   - Design deletion policies (e.g., "only purge changes acknowledged by 100% of active clients").

4. **Postgres Backend Hardening**  
   Prepare for a Postgres backend with:
   - Equivalent metadata integrity protections (triggers or `CHECK` constraints).
   - **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for true tenant isolation.
   - Updated `sync_log` ingestion pipelines for multi-tenant awareness.

5. **Security Enhancements (as needed):**
   - Cryptographic signing and verification of sync payloads (if clients become less trusted).
   - Enforce transport-layer encryption (HTTPS/TLS mandatory).
   - Scope-based OAuth authorization if adopting multi-user models.

6. **Enhanced Observability and Metrics:**
   - Integrate full metrics pipeline (e.g., Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).
   - Track key sync metrics:
     - Fetch latency
     - Apply latency
     - Conflict rates
     - Deferred operation rates
     - Client sync error rates

---

## Strategic Timing:

| Milestone | Trigger to Begin Next Phase |
|:--|:--|
| Local-first SQLite sync | ✅  (Now) |
| Small team (5–20 devices) | **Start server timestamp enforcement, deferred persistence** |
| Shared team-wide sync server | **Implement `sync_log` ACK tracking and garbage collection** |
| Multi-team/multi-tenant deployments | **Postgres hardening + OAuth/RLS** |
