Not waifus, but clippy:

Prompt Engineering page:
- 3 Sections
  - Prompt
  - Values
  - Response
- Looks like Claude Workshop UI window


Queue prompts while waiting for a response, split existing chat off into a new thread
  why can’t I queue a prompt while waiting for a response to generate?
  would be a huge QOL upgrade if we didn’t have to wait a full minute or two to submit follow-up queries
  even if it was just a single slot to put one query “on-deck” that would be huge
  add multiple slots and let the AI help manage the queue and now your chat interface is agentic

### Buttons
- Making better buttons
    - Make buttons look like buttons, don't use unusual shapes or styles
    - Differentiate between buttons and links - Buttons does something, links take you somewhere
    - Make the primary action button stand out - use color, size, and placement
    - Use simple labels for buttons - Don't use jargon or technical terms
    - Use clear and concise labels for buttons - Don't use long phrases or sentences
    - Use relevant labels for buttons - Don't use generic labels like "click here"
    - Use a 'large' font size for buttons.
    - Don't wrap text on buttons - text should be on one line
    - Use action verbs as button labels 
    - Don't use disabled buttons when possible - Show an error or CTA instead
    - Place buttons side-by-side when possible
    - Use standard layout for buttons - Don't use unusual icons or styles for buttons
    - Avoid icon-only buttons, use labels with icons whenever possible
    - Don't use two icons in the same button, one button, one icon.
    - Use enough/proper color contrast for buttons - Don't use low contrast colors
        * https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html
        * maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger text.
    - Use the right size for buttons - Don't use small buttons and don't use large buttons
        - Sizing of buttons can be used to denote priority, low-med-high
    - Use proper spacing & kerning for buttons - Don't use too much or too little spacing
    - Use a clear focused and hover states for buttons - visible focus state is important for keyboard users
    - Don't rely on colors to indicate states - use text / color / icons as well
    - Confirm with users the buttons work. Do user testing.
