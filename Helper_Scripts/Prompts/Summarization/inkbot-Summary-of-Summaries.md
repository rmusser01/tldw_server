Summarized Sections:
Chunk (1 of 3):
The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 is about to begin due to the growing rivalry between the French Empire and the German Kingdom of Prussia. Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck dreams of a united Germany under Prussian leadership and sees the war as an opportunity to bind the southern German states to Prussia. French Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie also have dreams of a glorious French Empire and see the rise of Prussia as a threat. The crisis that triggers the war begins in Spain, where Leopold von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is chosen to be the new Spanish king. This news is seen as explosive in Paris, as it is unacceptable to the French government that the Prussian royal house might also rule Spain. French Foreign Minister the Duc de Gramont sees this as an opportunity to humiliate Prussia or win a war against them. He demands that Prussia force Leopold to refuse the Spanish offer, but Prussian King Wilhelm I refuses to make the declaration. This leads to the Ems Dispatch, a manipulated message by Bismarck that reaches French newspapers on July 14, shocking the French government and pushing them towards war.

Chunk (2 of 3):
On July 14th, the Council of Ministers meets to discuss the demands made by French Foreign Minister Gramont to the Prussians. The ministers, who had not approved these demands, are divided but eventually agree to Emperor Napoleon III's proposal for an international conference to resolve the crisis and avoid war. However, Empress Eugénie and War Minister Le Boeuf pressure Napoleon III to scrap the conference and mobilize the army, and he gives in. This informal declaration of war against Prussia leads to a heated debate in the French Parliament the next day, where members ultimately vote to declare war and provide war credits. The French population is described as being in a state of fervor and excitement, with bands marching through the streets and people expressing their enthusiasm for war. In response, Prussia and its allies also mobilize their armies. In Bavaria, there is a debate among lawmakers about whether to join the war, with concerns raised about the safety of the Palatinate region. Some lawmakers argue that the Spanish throne question has nothing to do with Germany and that they do not want their region to suffer the horrors of war.

Chunk (3 of 3):
Bavaria and the southern kingdom of Württemberg are hesitant about joining the war, fearing the pacification of their kingdoms and jeopardizing their good relations with France. However, both kingdoms ultimately mobilize their armies. The Grand Duchy of Baden, despite having good relations with Prussia, decides to mobilize as they believe only Prussia can protect them in the event of war. With the mobilization of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Prussian King Wilhelm I now commands a full German army, but there is still no official declaration of war. The Ems Dispatch has given the war proponents in France and Prussia the excuse they need, with Empress Eugénie and Bismarck using the war to achieve their respective goals. Next week, the Franco-Prussian War will officially begin, marking the start of a new Prussian Empire.

The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 was instigated by the growing tension between France and Prussia, fueled by the latter's ambition to unite Germany under its rule and the former's desire to maintain its own imperial dominance. The conflict began when the French government objected to the candidacy of Leopold von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen as the new Spanish king, which they saw as a threat to their interests. This led to a series of events that culminated in the Ems Dispatch, a manipulated message from Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck, which incensed the French government and pushed them towards war. Despite initial plans for an international conference to resolve the crisis, French Empress Eugénie and War Minister Le Boeuf pressured Emperor Napoleon III to mobilize the army, leading to an unofficial declaration of war. Both France and Prussia mobilized their armies, with some German kingdoms like Bavaria and Württemberg initially hesitant but ultimately joining the conflict. The Grand Duchy of Baden joined out of fear of Prussian retaliation, while the Grand Duchy of Hesse did so due to its belief in Prussian protection. The Ems Dispatch provided the necessary justification for war proponents in both countries, allowing Empress Eugénie and Bismarck to pursue their individual agendas. Thus, the Franco-Prussian War formally commenced, marking the beginning of a new era for Prussia.
