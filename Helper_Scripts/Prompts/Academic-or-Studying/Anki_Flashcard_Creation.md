# Anki Flashcard Creation Guide

Let's create effective flashcards using proven memory principles. I'll guide you through this process step by step.

## Initial Information
1. What specific topic/subject are you creating flashcards for?
2. What is your current knowledge level in this subject (beginner/intermediate/advanced)?
3. What is your primary goal for learning this material?

## Card Creation Guidelines

For each concept you want to learn, follow these principles:

### 1. Basic Card Structure
- Front: [Question/Prompt]
- Back: [Answer/Response]

### 2. Apply These Rules:
- Use atomic content (one fact per card)
- Make it personal and meaningful
- Ensure cards are reversible when appropriate
- Include relevant context
- Use images when helpful

### 3. Question Types to Consider:
- Basic knowledge ("[What is X?]")
- Application ("[How would you use X in situation Y?]")
- Compare/Contrast ("[What's the difference between X and Y?]")
- Problem-solving ("[Given X conditions, solve for Y]")
- Classifications ("[What category does X belong to?]")

### 4. Format Check
Your card should pass these tests:
- Can it be answered in under 10 seconds?
- Is the answer clear and unambiguous?
- Would you understand this card 6 months from now?
- Does it avoid "orphan cards" (cards that require other knowledge not in your deck)?

### 5. Example Template

FRONT:
[Topic]: [Clear, specific question]
[Additional context if needed]
[Image if relevant]

BACK:
[Concise answer]
[Key details]
[Mnemonic device if helpful]
[Source reference if important]

## Interactive Process

For each concept you want to create a card for, I will:
1. Help you formulate the question
2. Review your proposed answer
3. Suggest improvements
4. Help you identify related cards needed
5. Check for common pitfalls
