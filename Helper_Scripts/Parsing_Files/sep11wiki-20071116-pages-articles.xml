Welcome to '''In Memoriam: September 11, 2001'''.

This website was started as a [[:en:Wiki|wiki]] in 2001 in response to the [[:en:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The aim was to allow a more detailed report of the event than would be allowed in an encyclopedia and which could include personal opinions. Part of the content here was originally uploaded to [[en:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]]. This project is no longer a project of the Wikimedia Foundation.

It was intended that this website be a complete history of the attack, including the background history, the aftermath, and more. The pages of In Memoriam provide an additional resource of personal opinions, individual experiences, memorials, and tributes, unlike content which could be added to an encyclopedia. All content on this website is released under the [[:en:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]].

There are '''{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}''' articles on this memorial site.

Jersey City, NJ
Back in 2001, it was my second day of my junior year of high school at St Peter's Prep, Jersey City, NJ. As on any other beautiful fall morning, the World Trade Center towers, so uninspiring from close up, looked spectacular from across the harbor when I got to school. Then, in the midst of my second period US History class, my former biology teacher, whose room was directly upstairs from where we were sitting, burst in, asking (in the sort of inanity we all perpetrate when faced with something incomprehensible) &quot;Does anyone here have a camera? Two planes just hit the World Trade Center!&quot; We all rushed over to the window to see what was going on. Despite being back-lit by the morning sun, the shadowy towers were glowing ghastly orange where they'd been blown up. Someone handed me a camera and I leaned out the window to document what was happening (it didn't seem to occur to any of us that this would be documented all too well). 

We drifted through the rest of the school day--with the trains stopped dead in their tracks and half the streets closed except for emergency vehicles, there was nowhere to go anyway. While putting some books away in my locker, I heard from my &quot;neighbor&quot; at the next locker over that one of the towers had fallen down. &quot;Sure it did,&quot; I said. Like my bio teacher who had broken the news that morning, this kid wasn't always the most reliable source of information, and from where we sat on Grand Street in Jersey City, just three blocks from the opposite shore of the harbor, less than a mile and a half from what was happening, we couldn't see anything but smoke. I assured him he'd probably just lost sight of the building behind the grayish plume that filled the sky.

I called my mother, elsewhere in Jersey City, from a payphone before I went to class, just to let her know I was all right and see if she knew anything more than I did. &quot;The World Trade Centers [sic...some people used the term in its plural form at the time, although it's less common now] collapsed...they're just gone,&quot; she said. Funny how you remember individual sentences. 

Meanwhile, on the western end of 57th Street in Manhattan, my father's 53rd birthday was, to put it mildly, ruined. He had watched the events unfold from a conference room window at WCBS-AM news-radio, where he worked at the time. To his amazement, his colleagues had gathered around a television set to see what was going on despite the fact it was going on just 75 blocks away out the window. Times like this, he reminisced whenever he looked back on the day (he passed away last year, unrelated of course), brought out people's most basic instincts, and the most basic instinct among most at CBS, even in the radio division, was apparently to watch television.

The school day got weirder and weirder as it progressed, understandably. Our principal reminded us that none of us could fix everything ourselves, so we shouldn't overreach and try to help stranded classmates get home unless they first contacted their families and made clear where they were going and when. His remark &quot;There will be no heroes today,&quot; rings in my ears when I think about it. Obviously, he didn't mean none at all, but it's a small glimmer of accidental dark humor in what was otherwise an unbearably dark day. By day's end, the cafeteria had developed, as Simon and Garfunkel might put it, &quot;an atmosphere of freaky holiday.&quot; Students, teachers, parents who had come to escort their kids home and see if there was anybody else they could help with a lift, janitors, everybody sat and jabbered mindless jabber, trying to find some shred of normalcy. A friend and fellow New York Giants fan quipped, however tastelessly (I've learned that in times this dark, the impulse to laugh to keep from crying trumps all decorum) &quot;This is the only time the Jets will ever beat the Giants.&quot;

My mother met me outside the school at day's end, and as F16's shrieked overhead (I remember thinking they were scarier than anything else going on), we headed through what open streets we could find, through the Greenville neighborhood where she'd spent her early childhood in the 1950s, where my immigrant grandfather had owned a print shop for many years, west to our home in Union County. It was only as we cruised along the eerily empty (even for mid-afternoon) Pulaski Skyway that it even occurred to me to cry, and cry I did. On the way home, we picked my dad up at the train station, and set a record for the longest group hug in history.

What makes the day so surreal to me, whenever I see or read anything about it, is that I realize how different it must have been for anyone who wasn't here, wasn't right on top of it, didn't smell the smoke. My cousin's now-wife was coated in soot when she got home, having been downtown for an audition. She was lucky she wasn't hurt, and I consider myself lucky that I wasn't any closer than I was. But let me tell you, whatever rhetoric the politicians were already starting in with by the end of the day, that was a million miles away from what it was like on the ground. The minutiae of tragedy: How do I get home? How do I find out if my friends and family are all right? What's going to happen after all the hospitals are full? That's what mattered.

It came as news to me that America was under attack, which is what the TV told me when I got home. As far as I knew, it was our backyard, our mother-city, our own corner of the world that was under attack. And while I have no doubt that the events of 9/11 and their aftermath have had a profound effect on all Americans, and indeed all citizens of the world, I believe it is important to bear in mind, especially in a country as large as the US, that there is a big difference between the feeling that comes with knowing some distant corner of one's country, bound mainly by a common flag and currency, has been attacked, and the primal fear that comes with a head full of sirens, a nose full of soot, and a sky full of smoke. Let us never forget the small things, because, as 9/11 as well as my father's sudden death last year reminded me, we are, ourselves, small things.

West Plains, MO
I woke up to go to school and my family was glued to CNN and NBC because of the attacks, and I was asking, &quot;What is going on?&quot;
&quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;What are these buildings?&quot; and similar questions.  I was almost a kindergartner and i had NO idea what was going on, so I went ballistic.  Then I found out more about the [[World Trade Center]], [[Pentagon]], and Pennsylvanian attack area on Wikipedia.  I then realized that all of those minutes passing that the United States and Americans' lives were changed forever.

Sault Ste Marie, Ontario Canada.

I remember this day being a typical day in grade 6, same old boring routine during the time of year where the school usually sells chocolate bars to raise a bit of money. The rest of the day is a blurr besides when our principal Mr.Cherra came into our class and told us that the world trade center's had been hit by two airplanes and just collapsed into dust and the Pentagon was also hit. I guess living in a Canadian society teacher's were allowed to talk about it and we did through-out the day, even though I thought the pentagon was the capital building back then, and imagining a typical 1930's foggy New York city being turned into chaos. Needless to say i was way off. When i walked in the door 5 hours later after school was out, I discovered my father glued to the TV taping news reports from CNN,ABC, and NBC saying &quot;This is history, someone needs to preserve what's happened today.&quot; After dinner I was a bit surprised to discover that my mother was the person who called the school to tell them about the event's that had just taken place, and prior to that she called my father saying &quot;We're under attack Len.&quot; Of course he just laughed it of not realizing what has happened. After learning all of this I couldn't really comprehend what happened, but i remember feeling really empty inside, or it seemed like more and more with each passing minute after the buildings collapsed, the world was changing.

Los Angeles

I awoke to my father telling me, calmly and coolly, that &quot;we're under attack.&quot; Nothing more. He left the room, and I got up and went to brush my teeth. I looked out of the window, half-expecting to see Chinese ships on the beach with troops streaming out, content just to conquer my small corner of the country. Instead, the clouds were reflecting the sunrise in a very normal manner. It was morning. It was any morning. 

I didn't understand what he had meant, and even I got in the car for him to me to the bus stop, I didn't ask. He didn't offer. He just turned on the radio and let NPR explain. I went to school, where only one of my teachers was willing to talk about it.  While the rest were content to ignore history all around us, my math teacher told us that she was scared, and we shared the now absurd rumors that were going about that day. That there were more planes in the sky. That it wasn't over. S.11 was over, in fact, but it was perhaps a tipping point we'll think about for decades.

México DF

En ese tiempo yo era estudiante de cine en la Universidad de Columbia. El 11 de septiembre, un amigo vino a decirme que fuera con él al Bronx porque estaban bombardeando Manhattan. Yo no le creí, por supuesto, pero mi roommate Carl me dijo que era verdad, me llevó a la sala y me mostró en la televisión el Pentágono ardiendo.  Están atacando a Estados Unidos, al país más poderoso del mundo. Nadie sabe quién. Yo pensé que era el fin del mundo, que era la Guerra Mundial que temía cuando era niño (¿qué hago yo aquí, en Nueva York, justo al momento de la 3a Guerra Mundial?, pensé). Le pregunté a Carl, pero quién nos está bombardeando ¿los chinos? No lo sabemos. 
Mi amigo tenía afuera un taxi.  Nos subimos a él y nos condujo hasta el puente que lleva al Bronx. Desde ahí se veía la imagen, una enorme estela de humo levantándose en el cielo de Manhattan.  Pudimos salir de la isla porque mi amigo enseñó que vivía en el Bronx. Caminamos y caminamos. La gente comentaba en la calle, mis paisanos mexicanos seguían trabajando. Eran los únicos que seguían trabajando haciendo la masa para las pizzas. Todos los otros meseros y cocineros estaban viendo la tele. Decían: dicen que están atacando con nuestros propios aviones. Hay más de 300 aviones volando por encima de nosotros.  Sentí terror. En cualquier momento podían comenzar a caer aviones sobre nosotros. 
A mi amigo le dio un ataque nervioso de ambre. Nos sentamos a comer una pizza y a ver la televisión. Entonces nos enteramos que todo había sido planeado por un grupo terrorista.  
Cuando llegamos a casa de mi amigo, revisé mi correo. Mi mamá me decía que sabía que yo estaba en un lugar lejos del WTC pero que me cuidara mucho (vivía yo en 125th con Riverside Drive, en un edificio de Columbia). También me escribieron amigos. Todos muy preocupados. Mi amigo que le daba por comer por nervios, volvió a desayunar. Entonces yo le dije que fuéramos al Ground Zero, que yo tenía una cámara digital y que como estudiantes de cine era nuestro deber documentar lo que estaba pasando. Le hice jurar que no grabaríamos nada que atentara contra la vida, esto es cadáveres ni nada truculento. Pasamos por la cámara a mi departamento como a las 12 del día y después de un largo caminar pudimos acercarnos al Ground Zero por el lado del Barrio Chino. 
Varias veces nos dijeron que nos saliéramos. Yo tengo alguna experiencia como reportero porque he trabajado en eso desde que tenía 19 años. También estuve en los terremotos del 85 en México, con mi papá, ayudando a la gente bajo los escombros.  Me uní a un grupo de obreros (tal vez me confundieron porque yo era mexicano y estaba lleno del polvo que seguía cayendo sobre todos nosotros). El caso es que con ellos entré al Ground Zero. Mi amigo no pudo entrar y regresó a su casa. Hice un pequeño documental/homenaje que al día siguiente transmitieron en NBC.  Después hice otro para ABC.  En ninguno de ellos muestro nada que pueda atentar contra la dignidad de los inocentes muertos.  
Me gustaría publicar algunas de las imágenes que tengo de ese documental. Para mí, haber visto a esa gente ayudando, levantando escombros, fue muy importante. Me recordó cuando mi papá me llevó a que ayudara en el terremoto en mi propia ciudad, México. 
Si el espacio aquí me lo permite, pondré más fotos. Por lo pronto, pongo esta imagen de un bombero que me parece que resume en su mirada lo que todos estábamos sintiendo ese día tan terrible y tan especial. 
Cuando volví a mi casa en el metro, estaba todo lleno del polvo blanco que seguía cayendo del cielo. Estaba como ido, como si fuera un zombi. Al día siguiente, en la iglesia de Columbia, asistí a la misa para los estudiantes que murieron (soy católico). Ahí, comencé a llorar. Lloré muchísimo, lloré con mis compañeros, con todos. Parecía que no pudiera parar.

Arlington, VA

I was living in Arlington when the Pentagon was hit.  I got into my van to drive over to my mother's house.  Upon leaving my condominium building and turning onto the main street, I noticed traffic was backed up from Washington, DC from the previous attacks.  I lived minutes from Key Bridge.  In front of me, stuck in traffic with the rests of us, was a black Mercedes SUV with tinted black windows.  The license plate read &quot;BIN LADEN&quot; (Virginia tags).  As I sat behind them, I debated with myself whether or not I should ram the vehicle and have the police determine if there was any link between the occupants of the SUV and any of the terrorists.  Then, I remember thinking about the Japanese-Americans who were put into US concentration camps after Pearl Harbor was attacked.  I struggled with trying to make a decision that, on one hand, might be a matter of national security, and on the other hand, might involve and potentially victimize a fellow American who had a vanity tag that was suddenly made politically incorrect that day.  About an hour later, while on the FBI webpage, I reported this on their site.  Later, I learned that Bin Laden was supposedly a common name and the likelihood of there being a connection with the occupants of the SUV was slim.  But, I'll always wonder if I made the right choice not to intervene when I could have during that brief window when our two paths crossed and our world forever changed.  John Thomas

Chicago IL 

I was driving in to work from Evanston and heard the report on NPR that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. At that point, they didn't know if it was an accident.  When I got to work at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I didn't listen to the radio or anything.  My colleague came into my office, all wide-eyed, and asked if I heard the news.  I said yes.  She said she had had a nightmare the night before about fire and flames.  At that point, I think she mentioned they thought it might be terrorists.  

At that point, I realized that I worked less than half a mile from the Sears Tower.  I walked down to another colleague's office and she was listening to the radio, I believe.  We looked at each other with disbelief.  Then the office manager and head of the department arrived.  I went back to my office and decided I was going home.  I went down to my office manager's office and she said that the department head said the university was open, we should all go back to work.  I said, &quot;I'm going home.&quot;  She said, &quot;Okay, but you'll have to take a personal day.&quot;  I said, &quot;Okay,&quot; and left.

When I drove home, the Kennedy expressway was pretty barren.  As soon as I got to the first stop light off the expressway, I looked over at the car next to me and the driver, a middle-aged woman, and I looked at each other in disbelief.  I thought about my family and did a mental checklist that no one was flying that day.  I went home and called all members of my family.  Everyone was okay.  I could not watch the news.  And I didn't until several years later. 

I still wonder how many people in those buildings were told to go back to work.

Place (me): Greensboro, NC
Place (my dad): Goteburg, Sweden

I was in fifth grade, just another 10 year old in a small city going to a small school, as with any other school day.  My mom and brother were at the same school, my brother in kindergarten, my mom teaching her 3rd grade class.  My dad was on a work trip in Sweden, across a sea, across an ocean, across numerous countries, not even in the same hemisphere.  Thousands of miles apart from each other.  I thought little of it, since he was supposed to return that Thursday, two days from September 11.  He didn't get back Thursday.  And I didn't find out what had happened until 6 hours afterwards.  

An announcement was made over the intercom saying that teachers were not allowed to turn on the television, causing my teacher to improvise a class, since we were going to watch a video.  In AL class at about 11, the instructor gave us a sheet of paper, face down, and told us to put it in our folder without reading it.  I read it, but only after school.  At the end of the day, I went to the cafeteria, where we usually gathered before going to our afterschool activities.  My mom was standing there, along with the afterschool coordinator.  There were no afterschool activities that day.  Everything was cancelled.  But why?  I still didn't know.

We had just gotten in the van when my mom broke down crying and told us about the attacks.  It took me a few moments for the information to sink in, but when it did, I opened the door and almost threw up, joining my mom in tears.  My brother, who was to young to really understand what was going on, just sat there.  We rode home in silence, not wanting to talk or turn on the radio.  

My dad called home that night and told us he was getting home, even though all US flights were cancelled.  He was given permission to leave early from what he had been doing and took a flight down to Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.  From there, he took another flight, this time to Mexico City.  Once there, he stayed the night with some relatives, after an exhausting 12-hour trip.  The following day, he took another flight on my uncle's airline to Monterrey, closer to the border, where he got on a bus and rode on it for many hours, until he arrived at Houston, Texas.  He stayed the night there at a Motel 6, leaving on another bus, arriving at Charlotte, NC, many, many hours later.

By now, it was Thursday, and he should have been home.  Our church held a special service for all those who had been murdered, and all those who had been separated from friends or family.  Crying, my mom and others prayed the rosary.  Thursday night dragged on.  We went home, and my dad wasn't there.

Friday morning.  We went to school, the three of us, with no sign of my dad getting home.  Somberly, we made it through the day.  And that night, after almost 80 hours, my dad arrived, having taken yet another bus to Greensboro and then a taxi home.  Around the world in 80 hours.  And this was one of the happiest tales.

He came home wearing the only clean shirt he had left, a shirt with the logo of some sports team or other across a background of the New York skyline.  With the Twin Towers proudly standing out.  I remebered the last (and first) time we had gone to NYC.  I had wanted to go to the top of the Towers and see the view from there.  We had climbed the Empire State Building, but the World Trade Center captivated me even more than the dusty old Empire State.  My mom promised me that the next time we went to New York, we would climb the Towers, all the way to the top, and see the city from there.  We still haven't returned, but someday, I will stand on the ground where they were and enjoy the beautiful surroundings from the ground, made all the more beautiful by the dark background, the ground which was burned on the bleak Tuesday, so long ago, yet not long enough ago.  I will return.

Place: San Juan, Puerto Rico

In September 11,2001 I found myself in my bed with the flu missing another day of school. When I woke up I turned on the television and instantly I knew something was very wrong. The north tower was on fire, and they kept saying the word &quot;accident&quot; and replaying the video over and over again. I called my mom who was making breakfast. We sat there watching the television in awe. Soon after the second plane hit. It was clear now that it wasnt an accident and that NY was under attack. That day I spent the whole day in my room watching the news wondering about a guy they called Osama Bin Laden who was a suspect in the attacks. I couldnt at that moment grasp the fact that the world would no longer be the same.

The next day I had to go to my school. In every class we talked about the attacks, and I found out that it had been announced in all the classrooms that something horrible happened in NY and that the World Trade Center Towers had collapsed. I had the opportunity to see it unfold live but there is nothing more worse than feeling powerless and knowing that while I was standing there in the comfort of my bed people were fighting for their lives.

The mother of a classmate of mine had booked a seat on one of the flights that crashed into the WTC. She decided to change the flight date at the last hour. She was lucky. Today (Sept 11/05) we honor all those who died in the WTC. NEVER 4GET.

Personal Experiences for the day September 11, 2001
●Place: Seattle, Washington
●Time: 7:45 am PST


To fully understand my September 11th experience I need to provide some background about what I was up to at this point in my life.  The previous year I had decided to take a break from my legal career and return to school to obtain a degree in computer science, ostensibly so I could become a patent attorney.  Accordingly, I returned to the life of a student and moved in with a couple of, for lack of a better term, wannabe hippies.

I had moved my TV into my bedroom.  On the morning of September 11th I was awoken by a phone call to one of my fellow roommates.  This roommate epitomized the absurdity of the people who would later blame America for September 11th.  He worked for an international shipping company negotiating shipping rates by day, and plotted anti-WTO activities by night.  Apparently the contradiction never occurred to him.  So I hear him say, “No, I have not checked the TV.” When you hear someone say, “Check the TV,&quot; this is not good.  So I turn on the TV and I see one of the towers burning and a replay of a plane hitting the other tower.  It did not really sink in as to what was going on.  Then, I see pictures of people jumping out of the towers to their deaths.  At this point I realize what is going on and its magnitude.  So there I sat in bed, 3000 miles away, watching people die.


The things I remember about that day apart from lying in bed are the following:

1)	I remember an audiotape of a woman, in fact a very attractive woman, calling home in terror that she was going to die. It really saddened me that this woman was never going to see her family again. I almost started to cry.

2)	The eerie quiet in the city of Seattle, no planes were flying, no people on the streets, just quiet.  The only noise was that of an F-15 Eagle flying circles over the city.

3)	All websites showing pictures of the towers burning on every webpage.

4)	A US Navy Frigate in Elliot Bay (Seattle’s harbor) on patrol.

5)	Calling friends in NYC to make sure they were okay, and having all the phone lines blocked due to everyone else in the world doing the same.

6)	Realizing that this experience would change America for years to come . . .

A story from me in Brabant, the Netherlands

I don't live in America, but I was really shocked when I heard about it.
I just came home from school, I remember my dad standing outside talking to some neighbours. I asked if what they were all doing outside, he told me to go inside and watch tv with my mom. So I did, I could not believe what I saw on tv. I kept watching tv till 11 pm that night. I coudln't turn away. the next day at school people were talking about it but dudn't seemed that shocked as i was. Maybe that's because I was thinking about going to New York with my mom. Maybe i felt more connected then my classmates did. 
A year after the attacks I went, I saw Ground Zero. I couldn't believe that there once were those big building. It seemed so small.

White Plains, New York-Lynne Sydelle Russo-Gordon

Its been over two years now, but I still remember every detail of that day.  It was a beautiful warm sunny clear sky day that Tuesday.  I had to go to work and then had class at Hunter College that night.  Little did I know what would await me that morning.  I worked in Lower Manhattan, less than two blocks East of the WTC.  I got off the 4/5 Express at the Wall Street Station, which is right across from 115 Broadway and Cedar Street where I worked.  I found that my building was being evacuated and no one could tell me why.  I could not find anyone that I worked with.  There was hundreds/thousands of people just walking or milling around.  Noone knew exactly what had happened.  Then someone said that the Twin Towers were on fire and that a plane had hit them.  I suppose in retrospect that I should have turned around and tried to get back on the subway and go home.  But a police officer shouted out to &quot;go stand over there&quot;, a get out of the way kind of order.  Many of us who were there just walked over to the Helmsley Plaza directly accross from Liberty Plaza and just stared dumfounded at the towers on fire.  I found out later that even had I tried to get back on the subway that they had already been shut down.  I had taken the last subway allowed to go to that area that morning. Then the first tower to fall exploded in a burst of white clouds of billowing smoke and slowly started to slip downwards.  The same officer who had directed us to stand there now shouted, &quot;run&quot; and we did.  But not fast or far enough.  We all were caught in the debris fallout.  Most of us made it out, some did not. The world went totally black and soundless, I never heard the buildings fall, I could not see, nor hear, nor feel, just smell and taste were left.  I could not breathe or think, nothing, the world just dissappeared in an instant.  I eventually made it out and home, but I have never been the same since.  I lost a major part of me that day and I am still trying to find her.  Peace/Lynne

'''Lynn, Massachusetts USA. Wikipedia User: Saint-Paddy'''
It was three years ago this September day that will live in my in my mind forever. 

It was '''9/11'''. This is my story. 

It started out at my old school, I was doing some BASIC during some freetime on the classroom Apple IIc. All the sudden the principal popped his head in and calmly said &quot;Could you please go over to residential&quot; So we got up and everyone was heading over to the building. One kid said &quot;I heard the Palestinians did it.&quot; Although I was always interested in world events, I didn't have a clue what was going. Then we got in the building and the TV in the kitchen was and what I saw would burn in my mind forever. The Twin Towers were on fire. So we sat down and started watching the plane hit over and over. I was there when the first tower collapsed. I didn't see it though because I was asked to &quot;Take 5&quot;(pretty much a time-out. I have autism and behavior problems) cause I was acting up. But I heard gasps. Then we went back to class and did our work. One class was watching the events on the TV in their room but we didn't have so we couldn't see what was happening. I got home at 3 o' clock and the news was on. I went on the net and read up on that day's events.
----
I am a U.S. Navy Veteran, that served on active duty from 1984-1993, in various hot spots of the world, including the Persian Gulf, during the Oil Tanker War. 

One month prior to the WTC Attacks, I was walking around, more or less homeless in Pittsburgh, PA near the Federal building. I smelled smoke, and heard screams, and Helicopters.  These images were so powerful, I could not ignore them. It was like they were there, but they weren't. I was confused. I kept smelling smoke, but didn't see any fires, or helicopters. I was thinking this was some weird flashback, to my experiences as a 1-inch gun operator on board a U.S. Navy ship in the gulf, or the SFO Quake of 1989, my ship was in SFO that day. 

I had had problems sleeping, mood swings, crying fits, for the last ten years, but did not want to go to the VA, and get help, only to become a burnt-out war vet, locked in a ward somewhere.  I remember thinking, &quot;Damn, this is some weird stuff, man, I got to just give in, and go to the VA, screw it.&quot; I sort of came out of it when I was almost killed by a Pittsburgh city bus, because I was wandering in the street.  That was a real eye opener.  For real, I now knew it was a flashback, or something, I was having. I had to get help.

I got to a VA shuttle. I went to the VA, PTSD clinic, in a fog. I had to pull out my driver's license to remember my name.  I made an appointment for further treatment, and some medication, I got a job referral, from a VA outreach program.  3 weeks later, I was working for a legal firm, scanning documents for companies and firms in new york, mostly corporate briefs and emails for pending legal cases.  People that we emailed to, back and forth, every day, worked in the WTC.  Sept 11, I was at work, Some girl came into the room, saying World War III had started, and New York City had been hit.  I remember thinking &quot;That's bullshit, it's not a military target like D.C., the missile fields in Montana, or any other strategic bases.&quot;  She kept crying and screaming.  Everyone was running out the door.  I figured &quot;What's the rush? Pittsburgh is in the top 20 hit list, and if it's true, we got a half hour to get out of town, and we'll never make, it, the bridges will be jammed. We'll be vaporized.&quot;  Our supervisor came in, and took charge, he told everyone to keep calm, to go home, and try not to panic.  Some people continued to keep working, but he told them, &quot;We're closed, go home, you'll get a full day's pay.&quot;  I had a friend, a gal at the next desk from me, she asked me what I thought.  I said &quot;We won't know for quite some time.&quot;  I walked with her to the bus stop.  By now, the streets of downtown Pittsburgh were as predicted, a madhouse.  Every bridge jammed. Cars trying to go out on the inbound lanes.  It reminded me of The Loma-Prieta Quake of Oct 1989.  Total panic, end-of-the-world stuff.  I thought, &quot;Wow, no shit, this is what I trained for my whole 9 years in the Navy, and here it is.&quot;  And so, being there, I was not scared. 

I decided to walk, because my bus ride home was not happening.  All the while, looking up in the air, wondering if I would see the flash, through the clouds.  Well, I kept walking, got hungry, figured I'll go to the Hotel across the street from the Federal building.  People were RUNNING left and right. nearly hitting each other with cars, horns honking. Bedlam. Chaos.  Sirens.  I walked into the hotel, they had a T.V. on in the lounge.  Lots of male business travllers in suits, shaking their heads. Women in business suits, crying into cellphones.  I saw the WTC on the tube, burning.  I though, &quot;Oh, Plane Crash.  Man, wow.  Hard core.  No survivors.  Not a war, and the day off.&quot;  No thought at all that the building would go.  Then as we watched, the second plane came, LIVE, and went for the second tower.  I KNEW, before it hit.  Jihad. Holy war. US vs THEM.  The World Was Going To Be Very Different, After Today. 

I remembered things I had been told in counter-terrorist courses over, and over, and over. We were vulnerable. But everything I had been taught was small scale: car bombs, grenades in a trash bag full of coke bottles.  A couple of bad guys with an AKM, or an Uzi SMG.  Nothing like this.  I felt that Pittsburgh was safe, but that New York was not going to be safe for any U.S. citizens with brown skin for many years.  I thought, &quot;Now maybe the civilians can understand, what military veterans have had to go through, in combat.&quot;  We watched, as people were diving out of the towers, just all the horrible stuff we have all seen of those images.  Women started SCREAMING in the lobby, totally freaked out.  

I thought, &quot;Holy war. Clinton should have taken out Iraq. My time there was wasted.&quot; 

I looked around, and thought, &quot;Now you all can wonder, 'Will I live through tommorow?' Like I used to.   Welcome to hell, welcome to war. Welcome to The Real World of Geopolitics. Your Previous Clinton Administration has failed you. The people get the government that they deserve.&quot;  

I then realized, my three weeks ago experience, was some kind of precognitive flash to these events.  To this day, I believe that.  I had similar experiences in the Gulf, that saved my life, many times, just a &quot;Knowing&quot; before really bad situations came up, like Vietname-era Jungle patrol point men army vets had told me about.  The VA says it is just a symptom of my illness.  When I talk about it, they want me to increase my medication dosage.  

U.S. Navy Veteran, now diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, at 70% disability.

I am just from a small town in Northern Indiana named Dyer. You probably have never heard of it, although it lies about 30 miles southeast of Chicago. Well, I work in Chicago for a computer consulting firm, and my assignment for September 10-14, 2001 was in New York City, World Trade Center Tower 1, 57th floor.

I was not worried about being in the Tower that was bombed in 1993. As a matter of fact, before I left for my trip to New york, I recall saying to my father, &quot;Don't worry Dad, lightning never strikes the same place twice.&quot; How terribly wrong I would be.

I arrived in New York on a flight from Chicago around 10 a.m. on Moday, September 10, 2001. I immediately went to my client's office in Tower 1 because I knew I had to accomplish much during this week. I left the offices around 8 p.m. that night knowing I had to get in early to get my work completed by the end of the week.

I arrived at approximately 7:45 a.m. the morning of September 11th. Picked up a cup of coffee and headed down to the server room on the 57th floor. I was just starting to load some software, when at 8:46 a.m. the plane hit.

It was a large &quot;THUMP&quot;, followed by the longest, and most intense explosion. The floor which I was standing on raised up about a foot and dropped me back down. Then the unimaginable happened, the building began to sway violently from South....then North......then South again. 

During this time, I kept saying outloud, &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;...&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; I thought the building was going over and I had absolutely nowhere to run.

Once the building stopped swaying, I knew I had to find a stairwell, not an elevator, a stairwell. Once I arrived at the stairwell, maybe 5 minutes after impact, a stream of people from the upper floors was filing by me.

I joined the procession and proceeded downwards. We were no more than 10-15 stories down when the second plane hit Tower 2. &quot;Booooommmmmmm&quot; muffled but strong through the stairwell. Women began to scream and cry. People stopped walking.....then some yelled, &quot;GO&quot;, and we began our procession down the stairs.

It took approximately 30-40 minutes for me to get out of the building that day and come out on the street next to St.Pauls Chapel. When I turned around and looked, both Towers were burning and bellowing black smoke. I was shocked and relieved that I made it out alive....now I had to contact my family back in Indiana.

My wife, she was 5 months pregnant at the time, and my first son was about to celebrate his 2nd birthday. By the time I got through to her, almost two hours had past. Both Towers were down and she knew nothing.

I recall her answering the phone saying, &quot;hello&quot;.....I said, &quot;I am alive, I am o.k.&quot; then we both broke down in tears. It took me quite a while to compose myself.

Now, almost two years afterwards, I still have every moment, every image frozen in my mind. I will never forget the sacrifice of those innocent people that day, and please, please, Never Forget.

&lt;b&gt;Colmar / France&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I came home from school at 4PM that day with a friend of mine, we settled in front of my computer, and fired up ICQ. As soon as I came online, a friend in Mexico contacts me: &quot;Have you heard?? - What? - A plane has smashed into the World Trade Center in New York!&quot;

At first, my friend and I thought it was a joke, some kind of lightning hoax. He told me to turn the TV on and see. As I tune into TF1 (a French national channel), the first thing I see is &quot;EDITION SPECIALE: NEW YORK&quot; in the top left hand corner of the screen, and people speaking about a video being aired live. At first, the camera is zoomed right in to what seems like a smoking hole, similar to what a terrorist bombing would blow in the side of a building.
Then, as the view zooms out, I realise that the hole was blown into the top quarter of one of the WTC towers.

At that point, I felt numbed more than anything else. I just sat and attempted to ingurgitate the waves of information pouring in.

I am not quite sure at which point in the overall strike I tuned in. I seem to remember that I saw the second tower being hit live, but the reports were running in all directions simultaneously, so the second hit was almost inserted in the flow of the first, as was the crash on the Pentagon.

For the rest of that evening, I stayed in contact with internet friends while watching the news, and one word slowly started to emerge more and more: &quot;WAR&quot;. That was the most frightening prospect for me. I could almost picture the world entering a third global conflict, with all the consequences that would have (nuclear weapons among other concerns). That prospect dominated my feelings much more than the thousands killed during the attack -- The millions that may start dying the next day worried me most.

The next day, things were eerily quiet at school. I met up with my friends and we had a brief round of &quot;have you heard the news?&quot; before going into class. I was surprised how little they seemed affected on the outside, but I reckon that we had silently agreed that there was no use speculating and panicking - we were too far away to do anything at this stage, so we would wait and see.
The teachers had obviously heard, though they kept very quiet about it. They simply said things in the line of &quot;I know what we all feel today, but the show must go on&quot;.

For a further week we had nothing but 24 hour coverage of the cataclysm on all national channels, which I believe dampened the impact on us: being constantly fed live coverage, playing the same five second footage over and over again, saying the same things every ten minutes made us less receptive to new information.

I must admit that I still cannot really visualise the present state of NY. When I thing of Manhattan, I still see the two towers rising high above the skyline for a few instants, before I remember that they are no longer there. I don't think I will completely believe that it happened until I actually see ground zero for myself.

----
&lt;b&gt;Frankfurt am Main, Germany / Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was on a two-week vacation in Germany, visiting family &amp; friends, and attending a wedding.  Two days after the wedding, my mother and I decided to go shopping before visiting some of her friends.  That afternoon, we drove to her friend's place for coffee.  We parked, and walked up to the door.  The minute we stepped inside, our hosts asked us if we had heard &quot;the terrible news&quot;, which we had not.  A plane had flown into the World Trade Center, and was on the news stations.  

We stepped to the television in the living room, and sure enough, the news station was replaying the first crash.  As I watched, the second plane flew into the WTC.  It was only then that the scope of what had happened hit me.  I immediately thought of friends living in the area.  And as news announcers spoke of terrorists, I found myself thinking &quot;OK, we need to go to Israel and Palestine, and set up a 'Green Line' like in Cyprus, and tell those two communities to stop squabbling like toddlers.&quot;  It struck me just how unproductive such unilateral action by the USA would be.  The Pentagon was attacked next, and I was thinking the word &quot;war&quot;.  

Shock set in.  My elderly grandmother, who I saw later that afternoon, had seen the news.  Due to her senility, she did not comprehend what had happened.  I felt more distant from her right then, not five feet from her, than I ever did when growing up thousands of miles away in the United States.  My mother and I returned to the house where we were staying during our visit.  One of the residents of our host's apartment house had been en route to Washington, DC that day, only to return due to the closure of all US airports.

I spent the next few days attempting to reschedule my flight home, which had originally been planned for the Friday following.  I used the Internet at every opportunity to keep track of German- and English- language news sources.  I contacted friends, my brother, and my partner, all via email.  I channel-surfed, bouncing between CNN Atlanta, BBC, CNN Europe, and Germany's NTV.  As I calmed down, and had my flight rebooked, I was able to note the differences in reporting from the various stations and languages.  Observing the differences helped me to come to terms with what had happened.

I arrived back home, safe and sound, a week later.  At work, I learned that my coworker's cousin had been on one of the flights to crash into the WTC.  Another's sister had been scheduled to be on one of the two planes, but missed it due to filling in for a sick coworker on another flight.  A friend had a former colleague who worked on the 94th floor of one of the towers.

I still grieve, still have not fully come to terms with the event, even six months later.  I doubt that I ever will.  Where does man's inhumanity to man end?

----
Bellevue, Washington.  It was very early in the morning over here.  I had just woken up when my telephone rung.  I answered it and it was my step-sister, Erin, who is serving in the Airforce stationed in Sacramento, California.  As she told me the horrific news, I couldn't believe it.  She said she may have to go over to New York, and she wanted to tell her dad, but he wasn't there.  When I hung up, I ran to the television.

I turned it on to see the horrific scene of the first plane crashing into one of the towers.  Ignoring that I had school in an hour, I sat down and watched the news.  At that time, they said anywhere from 5,000 to 50,000 people may have been in the towers.  Of course, this number decreased as time went by.  Then I saw the second plane hit live on TV, I couldn't believe it.

When I got to school, all the students were speaking about the terrorist attack.  Teachers weren't allowed to talk about it.  Feelings of unease and vulnerability were felt by everyone.  It was really hard to comprehend.  People here were scared that a terrorist attack could happen everywhere and everyone was in danger.  Luckily, another major terrorist attack would not happen in the US.

My story may not be that exciting, but I'm glad it is how it is.  I was on the opposite side of the United States from the attacks.  I had not lost any friends or family.  My deepest sympathies to all those who have such stories to tell, or all those who would have those stories if they were alive right now.

Breukelen, Holland, I was working at the time, having fun. My friend walked in and told me two plaines had crashed and WTC had collapsed. I thought she was joking, but she wasn't. I went home at 18.00 (our time) afraid to watch television, afraid to find out that it was all true. 3 hours later I still couldn't believe that it was true. I couldn't sleep that night, I kept thinking about my family, who live in the USA. The following morning I remembered a poem, I don't know who is the author but I know it can give some of you the comfort they need.
 memories keep those we love
 close to us forever
 although words seem to say so little
 I hope they help in some small way
 to ease the sense of loss
 that you're experiencing today
 hold fast to your memories
 to all of the cherished moments of the past
 to the blessings and the laughter
 the joys and the celebrations
 the sorrow and the tears
 they all add up to a treasure of fond yesterdays
 that you shared and spent together
 and they keep the one you loved
 close to you in spirit and thought
 the special moments
 and memories in your life
 will never change.
 They will always be in your heart
 today and forever more...

my thoughts are with you... kim de jong

September 11th was a day of surreal chaos. It's funny the ways in which these things hit you. I wasn't struck by the magnitude of what had happened until I walked out of the battlefield wasteland that used to be the financial district and saw a makeshift blood donation center in a park. A few ambulances and gurneys. People lined up. Other people holding up handwritten signs for AB-, O+ and such. Beyond that some construction workers gather supplies, presumably for the rescue efforts. There were tables set up with fresh water and snacks for people who needed them. I saw a table in front of a fire station with a phone sitting on it and sign saying, &quot;Need to make a phone call?&quot; Finally I come to the police barricade set up to hold back the throngs of gawkers trying to get a closer look. It was at this point that I started wandering the streets of NYC struck by the reality that 10,000 people probably just died, close enough for me to watch it happen. Wandering the streets covered in dust, catching snatches of conversation about the fucking [[en:Arab|Arabs]], noticing people looking at my dust-covered clothes.

At one point earlier in the day, I broke down crying thinking about my friend Jas. Jas works in one of the builings directly adjacent the [[en:World Trade Center|WTC]], and the very real possiblity existed that he might be dead. Jas might be dead! The thought of that was more than I could bear. (I just heard word from him about and hour ago. Thank God.)

It was another banal day at work yesterday morning. I came in about 8:35am, five minutes late again. Had a voice mail waiting for me from my boss from last night. Something that needed doing first thing in the morning. She wouldn't be coming in until later. Check my email. More drama from an exgirlfriend I thought would be a good idea to get back in touch with. Settle down to get started working. Someone comes running down the hall blabbering something about the [[en:World Trade Center|World Trade Center]] and an airplane. Typical over-reaction, it's probably nothing. Regardless, I wander over the window to see what's going on and see a gaping hole in the side of the building belching flames and smoke. All I can think about is the movie [[en:Brazil (movie)|Brazil]]. Almost all of the debris fluttering around my office building is paper, files dislodged because of the explosion. When I see the second plane buzz by my office, bank around, and smash into the other tower in a huge explosion, I feel like I'm watching a movie. Everything was in slow-motion, huge fireball, very spectacular. Watching the events on [[en:Television|TV]], complete with comentary, then seeing the actual thing out the window somehow adds to the unreality of it all.

The other people in my office are milling about confused. Should we stay and get back to work? Should we go home? I think most of the people feel the same way about it as I do, most of them preferring to watch the events on TV rather than out the window. It feels so far away even though it's so close. Sarah is fighting to hold back tears fucking terrified and babbling about how we need to get the hell out of here. I put a hand on her shoulder and tell her to go home; it's ridiculous for us to stay here. She stands transfixed by the news reports, hugging herself, holding back tears.

I go back to my desk wondering what to do. It's announced that the office is closed and we should go home. I call my dad to tell him I'm okay. I figure the worst is over. The attack is done. I'm safe. I'll wait until the chaos of people trying to get home dies down before I try to get out of there, so I talk to my dad a bit, respond to some emails from people asking if I'm alright, try to get a hold of people who might be worried about me.

Eventually, I go downstairs and outside, start smoking a cigarette. There's still a lot of people milling about in front of the building. I try to call some friends on my cell phone. All circuits are busy at this time. I'm pondering the mob in front of me when everyone starts running. No one knows where to run to. Everyone is just following everyone else. I hear people talk about how the tower has collapsed as they scurry by, and I feel a twinge of real fear thinking that the skyscraper has actually fallen over. It's tall enough that it would have fallen very close where I was. I'm not sure what to do seeing the futility of just blindly running. When I see the cloud the dust billowing towards me, I hurriedly make my way back inside.

Back in my office on the 38th floor, it's dark as night outside. The dust obscurs everything. We are all asked to gather in the 37th floor conference center. I talk to someone covered in debris. He was caught in the dust cloud trying to walk home and forced to come back to the office. Other people are relating their stories of coming out of the commuter train station in the basement of the WTC when the first plane hit. Slow trudging up the escalator turned into frantic running as rescue worker yell at people to get the hell out of there. Others are trying to figure out how to get home to [[en:New Jersey|New Jersey]] or upstate [[en:New York|New York]] as much of the city's public transit and roads are shut down.

We all sit in a conference room drinking coffee and munching pastries. [[en:CNN|CNN]] is continually blaring on the projector TV giving constant commentary on what's happening right outside. I start crying thinking about Jas. All I want is to be among friends, drinking a beer, ignoring the reality I'm caught in, but I'm stuck in this building until the smoke clears enough outside for me to be able to breathe. I'm reminded of [[en:Burning Man|Burning Man]], and I wish that I had the mask and goggles that were a constant accessorie out in the desert. I just want to get the fuck out of there.

People are lined up to use the phone. All circuits are busy at this time. When It's my turn, I pull out my palm pilot and try to call everyone I know. Reaching people in [[en:Idaho|Idaho]], [[en:Oregon|Oregon]], [[en:California|California]] is no problem. Reaching people in [[en:New York City|NYC]] is nearly impossible, but I manage to get through to a few. Everyone is relieved to know I'm still alive.

Milling about the office waiting for the dust to settle. I manage to sneak onto a computer for a bit and reply to emails from people asking if I'm okay. Everyone is eerily calm. Reality hasn't really sunk in. People are more concerned with how they're going to get home.

By 2pm the air is fairly clear, even though smoke is still rising from where the [[en:World Trade Center|WTC]] once stood. I'm one of the last people to leave the office. Outside, I smoke a cigarette then tie a t-shirt from my gym bag around my face. None of the buildings where I am are damaged, but everything is covered with dust and debris. Very few people are out on the street. The entire landscape is transformed.

Walking out of the disaster area police usher me away from the location of primary destruction, but I manage to catch a glimpse of a pile of rubble obscurred by smoke and fire. I'm in a slight state of shock. I'm just walking without any definite destination in mind.

After the blood donation center, after the police barricade, back in the &quot;normal&quot; world, I find myself a couple blocks from Deborah's apartment. It takes about five or six tries, but I finally get through to her on my cell and invite myself over. Once there, she's throwing things into a bag on her way out of [[en:Manhattan|Manhattan]]. She's spending the night at a friend's in [[en:Brooklyn|Brooklyn]]. He freaked her out with thoughts of continued terrorist attacks, anthrax, nerve gas, and insisted that she spend the night with him, away from the epicenter of these phantom attacks. She's in a panic, the valium she took just muddying her mind and not calming her nerves. I calm her down and walk her to one of the few subway lines that are running. She promises to take me out for drinks tomorrow night.

I go to Edward's next, not wanting to take the long journey home. He has spent all day watching the news, popping valium, and drinking beer. I join him in the valium and beer and ask that the TV be turned off. I'm sick of thinking about what's happened today. We watch [[en:Golden Girls|Golden Girls]] instead.

It's about 8pm and people are finally starting to be able to get through to me on my cell phone. My roommate calls and is glad to know I'm not hurt. She tells me I've got a ton of messages and my boss called to say there would be no work tomorrow. no shit A few other people call. Erin is on her way to [[en:Canada|Canada]] with her boyfriend and Tae is spending the night in a hotel in [[en:Manhattan|Manhattan]]. The city is still mostly closed off.

Edward lives on 10th street and the city has been closed south of 14th. We go out looking for some food and [[en:McDonald's Corporation|McDonald's]] is about the only thing open. There's line going out the door and down the block. We manage to find a bougie little bistro selling over-priced hamburgers. I enjoy my first meal since breakfast.

I spent last night on Edward's couch being too exhausted to want to try to get home. I got up late this morning to coffee, more news of what's happening, and more emails from people wondering how I'm doing. Part of me is happy about not having to go to work today. Edward's boyfriend had to go in. He works in mid-town. The reality of what happened still hasn't fully sunk in. Stuff like this happens every day in [[en:Beirut|Beirut]], right?

It's strange not seeing the twin towers rising above the [[en:New York City|NYC]] skyline anymore.

'''From my point of view:'''&lt;BR&gt;
I was feeling more upset than I had realized, and after spending the day picking through my feelings I went home to my uptown apartment feeling much better. Once there, I got a love letter from Katya, and that made me feel much better. So, I climbed up to the roof of the apartment to write sonnets and read [[en:Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], dressed appropriately.
After a while I called Katya, using my new ultra-swank headset / microphone, so I could leave my hands free and chat about nothing and everything for hours on end. And, of course, standing on the rooftops I felt that I was compelled to shout out &quot;She Loves me!!!&quot; at the top of my lungs -- when one is presented with the opportunity to shout it from the rooftops, one really must, I feel.


'''From the Neighbors' point of view:'''&lt;BR&gt;
The day after the WTC tragedy, where more people were killed in an instant than I can even imagine, they see a guy dressed all in black climb up to the top of the roof. He sits for a while, writing a long note, and then gets up. He starts pacing back and forth right on the edge of the roof. He is talking to himself with great animation, and at one point even starts screaming...

'''From my point of view:'''&lt;BR&gt;
So I look over the edge of the roof during the phone conversation, and notice a cop car... turns out all the cops are staring at me... I smile and wave to show them that I'm not tresspassing, and the cop shouts back &quot;Just stay right there!&quot; Then I turn around, and notice two of the nicest, least-threatening policemen I've met slowly walking towards me, at which point I realize what happened and become quite embarrassed. All told, in addition to the four cops on the street (to catch me in their arms?) there were eight policemen and women on the roof with me! I apologized profusely, and they were really good about the whole thing. One of them said that it &quot;broke up the day&quot; and gave them a chance to chat to each other... I guess it must've been a bit of a relief for them to get a call that wasn't a life or death situation at all. The head cop had to keep repeating himself to the dispatcher, &quot;There is no EDP on 78th st. That's a negative -- no EDP&quot;. Whatever an EDP was, I'm glad I wasn't one. Wheeee!&lt;BR&gt;

*Name: Fritz Swanson
*Location: [[en:Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], MI
*Experience:
I teach at the [[en:University of Michigan|University of Michigan]], and my days at work are Monday, Wednesday and Friday. My first class is at 9 am. So, my alarm is always set to 7:30am every morning so that I can get used to the fall routine of getting up early. It's a radio alarm which I have set to [[en:National Public Radio|NPR]] and I wake up every morning to Morning Edition and listen to what is happening. It's a [[en:General Electric|GE]] alarm clock, and I don't know about other clocks because this one is old an dthe only alarm clock I have ever had, and the reason I say all of this is to say that it only plays the radio for one hour. I guess that is so that it will turn off after you have left. [[en:General Electric|GE]] figures you will wake up when the radio comes on, and before the hour is over you will be out the door. [[en:General Electric|GE]] market research must have determined that most people set their alarm to, like, forty-five minutes before they have to leave or something.

Anyway, what this means is that on Tuesday the alarm turned the radio on at 7:30am. But I didn't have anything to teach, and my girlfriend doesn't need to be to work until eleven, so we just rested in bed listening to [[en:National Public Radio|NPR]]. Now, right now, I don't know what was on. I don't remember anything about the program. I just remember being in bed with my girlfriend, waking up slowly to the sound of Todd Mundt and the other [[en:National Public Radio|NPR]] people and just sort of relishing how relaxing the day seemed already. I had almost no grading to do and nothing scheduled at all. So I just laid in bed for an entire hour until the radio turned itself off. The radio figured I should be at work by now and I didn't feel like arguing.

So I got up. It was 8:30 am and I got. Normally when I get up I go to watch the weather channel, but because I had listened to so much radio, all of it so wonderfully calming, and because I had no where to be that day, I didn't turn on the TV. I just picked up the new issue of [[en:Wired Magazine|WIRED magazine]] and started to read an article about Programmable Matter. There was stuff about quantum wells and semiconductors and all kinds of sci-fi possibilities for matter that could change its actual elemental make up. Gold to lead. [[en:Alchemy|Alchemy]]. Transmutation.

And then my friend David Nelson called. Sara answered the phone and she said, quickly, &quot;Dave says that the internet is down and that we need to turn on the TV.&quot;

So I did. And there was a shot on [[en:CNN|CNN]] of two smokestacks, one of them smoking and the other not. And I had no clue what I was looking at. It was a moment where the perspective was all shot and it was unclear how big anything was supposed to be. Out of the right side of the frame came an airplane, and it seemed like it must have been a model, because of its apparent size as related to the smokestacks. And then the plane hit the second smokestack, which, at that moment, became the WTC. I could see that it was a pair of buildings and the second one was detonating, and then I could hear what [[en:Aaron Brown|Aaron Brown]] was reporting.

And at first I laughed. And I thought, this is like some movie. And now, days later, I realize what I meant in my mind when I thought, This is like a movie.

What I meant, what I think every one means when they think, this is like a movie is this: They mean that this is NOTHING like a movie because it is happening.

And everything was sort of out of whack.

New York, New York.

On September 11th, I woke up late to get to the school bus. School buses in the city are an oddity, but I was going to school on the far end of Brooklyn, and so I took the bus every day. I missed the bus, and quickly got to a stop of a bus on a different route with a minute or two to spare, and was whisked away to school. We got there at about 7:45, starting off the worst day of my life. I had drama first, and I actually fell off the stage, backwards onto the front row of chairs. It was really painful, and looking back at it, it must've happened around the exact time of the first hit. Going to my next class at 9:15, a kid stopped me and said &quot;hey, did you hear? A plane flew into the twin towers!&quot; I thought he was joking, trying to scare me. I went into my classroom where my teacher was standing there, looking worried. When everyone settled down, which takes awhile in a class of 7th graders, she said &quot;Ok, we have to go to the theatre for an emergency assembly&quot;. That shut us up quick. As I walked in, I saw one of my favorite teachers talking to another teacher. I went to talk to him, but heard him say &quot;This is world war III. We're going to fucking nuke them&quot;. Those words truly still haunt me. I did not talk to him, or say hi. I went to a seat, and sat down to listen. The headmaster began to talk.

The majority of what he said is a blur, but he was very official about it. He laid out the facts, said things like &quot;Our information is limited&quot; and &quot;We're working very hard on getting you all home&quot;.  Someone raised their hand and asked about kids from Manhattan, accessible from Brooklyn only by tunnel, bridge, or subway, all of which were shut down. He said &quot;You will not be able to get home&quot;. I burst out in tears, doing my very best to hide it from the other kids around me. 7th grade boys don't cry, not if they don't want to be made fun of. It was my 5th day at a new school, i had no friends, nowhere to sleep. I milled around my school, looking into various rooms to watch CNN being played on staticy TVs meant only for DvDs and VHSs. I called my parents from cell phones, but the reception was staticy and the connection went in and out. They sounded scared, which scared me further. I was sent home with a teacher. We ate all night, lots of things, and tried to watch happy, funny movies to make ourselves feel better. It didn't work, the fear and anger and sadness in our minds much stronger than Billy Madison. I spent the most of the night lying in an unfamiliar bed, crying and shaking.

The next morning, September 12th, was a beautiful one. Except for the large cloud of dust rising over my home. My mom came out on the subway to pick me up, and brought coffee and donuts for the family that had housed me. She came in through the front door, and i ran to her, crying and screaming. She held me and cried with me. Our subway ride back took more than twice as long as usual, riding back underneath the chaos that had been our city.

The phone rang very early in our apartment in San Francisco. I wondered who it was. Jeremy went to answer it. When he came back he was very quiet. &quot;Who was it?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Bryan,&quot; he said. &quot;Terrorists have flown planes into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon. The Pentagon's on fire, and the towers have collapsed.&quot;

&quot;You're joking,&quot; I said, but he wasn't.

Durban. South Africa.  A colleague rushed into my office to tell me that a plane had just crashed into one of the WTC towers.  She was quite excited because she had just returned from New York two weeks previously and had stood atop the one on a lovely summer's day.  I went to the net immediately but could not access CNN.  I tried the BBC instead.  No luck.  Eventually a lonely pic of the tower with a hole in it presented itself on CNN.com.  It looked almost like a model someone had dummied up with a shoebox.  I phoned a friend who didn't know and minutes later he got back to me to say that he had heard on the radio that another plane had ploughed into the second tower.  I didn't believe him and tried to access CNN.com a second time.  This time it took even longer to get a hit.  But when I saw it I believed...and rushed through to our company pub to take it all in on CNN.  People just sat there gob-smacked...as though watching a surreal Schwarzennegger movie...and believing no doubt that they would wake up and it would all be over.  An hour later the name Bin Laden was first mentioned...

New York, New York.

I live in a co-op on West 103rd St. and Riverside Dr. I woke up late on Tuesday, September 11, 2001 unexplainably tired. I left my building at 8:50 a.m. or so and took the Number 1 subway at the West 103rd Station. Everything seemed normal when I got off at the West 50th St. station; I really do not remember the details because there was nothing exceptional about the morning commute.

I went up to the 4th floor of my firm?s building on Ave. of the Americas. As I was entering through the glass doors to the office, I heard someone ask someone else, ?Did you hear about the plane that crashed into the [[en:World Trade Center|World Trade Center]]??&lt;BR&gt;One of them laughed; I thought they were kidding and as I headed to my office I said to myself, ?It is disgusting to make jokes like that, they are creating bad [[en:karma|karma]] for themselves.

I turned on my computer and got ready to start my day, when my officemate, a lawyer on exchange from our London office, asked me, ?Did you hear about the accident??&lt;BR&gt;It was then that I knew something was wrong and that this was no joke. He was watching the news report from the [[en:BBC|BBC]] on livestream video on his computer. And then I saw the images and could not believe my eyes. We watched it all happen on the [[en:Internet|Internet]], from the second crash to the collapse of the first tower.

I immediately became concerned about my boyfriend, who works on Fulton St. I called his office repeatedly but there was no answer, not even the voice mail picked up.

There were no security announcements in my building, which is quite tall, so I decided that the best thing to do was to leave and head down to the East Village, where my boyfriend lives, hoping that he would have evacuated the area in time. I met a friend at the corner of Ave. of the Americas and West 52nd St. and we made our way down Park Ave.

There were thousands of people leaving their buildings. Everybody looked concerned. Tears formed in my eyes every time I thought of my boyfriend. I tried using my cell phone repeatedly but it was not working.  It must have taken me an hour or so to make my way down to St. Mark?s Pl.  I entered my boyfriend?s apartment and I found him there, watching the news on TV. I cannot describe the sense of relief I felt upon seeing him.

The following days were gut wrenching as the images played over and over on TV and as the pictures in the newspapers showed the extent of the destruction. There is one image I cannot erase from my mind: [[en:The New York Times|The New York Times]] ran a picture of the big gaping hole in one of the towers, and if you look carefully there seems to be a man standing by a window. Even if it was an illusion, this is what I saw in that picture and the thought of him dying, whoever he was, still makes me want to cry.

It has been more than one week now after the attack and we try to return to normal. But it will never be normal again. Everywhere I walk I see flyers of people who disappeared in the rubble. I feel like I am living in a different world now.

S., Maine

This is my experience of that day, at least some of it.

I had just biked over to the gym here and when I walked in I heard people saying that &quot;they&quot; had bombed the WTC and then the Pentagon.  What??  That's crazy!  We all crowded into the maintenance closet where we watched a b&amp;w tv.  I had an overwhenlming compulsion to call my husband at work - the company should go on high security (as if my thoughts on that were necessary), and my Mom.  We had just been in NYC that weekend to see the Wayne Thiebaud exhibit.  We had not been there for twenty years or so.  As we were leaving on the train I pointed out the WTC to my husband and mentioned the 1993 attack.

As I wandered about the gym, I remembered that my friend's husband flies for American out of Boston.  I tried calling her.  No answer.  Got home and tried again.  And, again.  The video of the building collapsing made we want to throw up, or faint.  I told my husband I needed him to come home.  I called my friend and she answered the phone cheerily.  They were in the yard working and had no idea what had happened, no idea why their crazy friend was hysterical on the phone - hysterical with relief.  It's not any better that it was not my friend's husband, it is still too awful for thought much less for words.  My relief was that my friend would not have the pain of her family coming apart.

I got a shower, my husband came home.  I stopped being hysterical, although I was still crying and sick at heart.  I keep watching the tv trying to actually believe this has happened.  Removing those buildings from the skyline of NYC that lives in my head is like removing some vital part of language from my vocabulary.

My day had pretty much started out the same on September11, 2001. I got up and took my shower and left for school. I went to English first period and turned in my research paper on the British poet Robert Browning and had class as usual. As I came out of first period(about 9:30am central time) one of my friends came up to me and had this blank expression on her face and all she could say was &quot;Can you believe this!!&quot; I had no idea what so was talking about so she finally told me that two planes had just crashed into the World Trade Centers and one had already callapsed and that a plane had crashed into the Pentagon. To tell the truth I never really worried about what was in New York because I  live way down here in Alexander City, Alabama. So I didn't really know how big the trade centers were and how devastating this terrorists attack was; on the other hand I did know what the Pentagon was so that got me worried. See my father works in Washington D.C. and he often works in government buildings. Luckily this day he was working at one of the CIA buildings.As we came into Second Period the whole class was in front of the television watching the other trade tower fall. I was speechless as I watched these people run for their lives. It was worse than any movie because this was real people and it was here in America &quot;the beautiful&quot;,my home. We spent the whole class period just watching these videos of the planes crashing into the towers and people jumping out of windows. No one knew exactly what to say or even think about the whole situation. I know a lot of us were thinking that all we want to do is graduate high school before all our friends end up being drafted, this is our senior year, what we have been waiting for. I get out of school at 11:30AM and as I came out my boyfriend was waiting for me out by my car(he's 19 and was supposed to be at the community college).He was feeling the exact same way I was feeling, confused and a little scared of what else was going to happen. We went on to my house and just hung out together with my family. Then when 7:30PM came we all sat down together as a family and watched President address our nation. Bush did excellent and it touched my heart especially when he quoted scripture from the bible. I was glued to the tv for a couple more days and I still can sit there and listen to it for hours but sometimes you just have to get away.

I am a lawyer in Massachusetts. On Tuesday September 11, 2001 at about 8:30AM I arrived at a local courthouse to deal with several pending cases. A court officer came up to me in the hallway and told me that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center; I assumed it was a small plane that had perhaps gone off-course. I retreated to the court officer's lobby where I saw on TV the damage wrought by two commercial jets. At that point it was apparent that the attacks were intentional; we also then learned  that both planes had been hijacked from Boston. I stared in disbelief at the burning buildings. Shortly after this, we learned of the Pentagon and Pennsylvania hijackings. We watched as the buildings collapsed, not believing what we were seeing. All courts in Massachusetts were then ordered closed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. I went home and contacted family members in New York and Florida.

In May of 2001 I took my wife to the top of Tower 2 for a drink at club called &quot;The Greatest Bar On Earth&quot;. We each had a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne and watched the sunset. The view was astounding. If you told me then what would happen to those buildings and those people I would have laughed in your face.

Perth, Western Australia

I was just drifting off to sleep at about 9PM when I heard my mother, who had been listening to the radio, come storming down the hallway and flicking through the channels on the TV. Curious, I dragged myself out of bed, and came into the lounge room. Mum had found CNN being relayed through the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), who had suspended regular programming.

I could see an image of the World Trade Center with smoke billowing from both of the twin towers. Soon, they flicked to images of the Pentagon on fire. My whole family sat on the couch, glued to our TV screens. The images seemed impossible, less real than the movie Independence Day. We were terribly shocked, even more so because our Prime Minister, John Howard, the leader of Australia, was in Washington at the time, and none of our TV news networks knew if he was alright. It turned out he was fine, but he was close enough to see the plane slam into the Pentagon from a window. We sat, watching the unfolding tragedy, for hours.

The world will never be the same again.

God Bless Australia, and God Bless America.

Chicago, IL

I had a job interview--I had been part of the dot-bomb world, terrified of not getting a job--and I was driving on I-290 on my way to Westmont when Noah Adams broke into a fluff piece on NPR about young teachers in Chicago.  A plane had hit the World Trade Center, he said, but it wasn't clear why.  Maybe the navigation system broke?  Maybe it was a commuter plane?  Maybe a private one?  maybe... maybe...

I arrived at the company building for my interview, got out.  I was early, so I wandered into the cafe.  A second plane had hit.  It wasn't an accident, it was on purpose. I sat there for 20 minutes, just watching, in shock.  I took out my cell phone, to try to reach my brother, but I couldn't get through.  So without anything better to do, and because operating on autopilot was easier than figuring out how I felt, I went into my interview.

I didn't get the job.

By the time I came out, the towers had collapsed, the pentagon had been hit, and a plane had crashed in Pennsylvania.

It's odd how a futile hour and a half, with people I'll never see again, changed the world.

That night, I was sitting at home, after having been glued to the TV all day, when I saw it for the first time.  The camera panned across people hanging out the windows above the fires, before the buildings collapsed.  Tons of them.  You could pick out the colors of the suits they wore.  They were at the windows, just standing there, wind whipping the skirts and the hair and the ties.  And then one fell.  And another.  And another.  Like popcorn beginning to pop.  Now, a month later, those are the images that won't leave my head.

New York, NY

I was at the World Trade Centre (I work at the World Financial Centre building, across the highway from the WTC) on Tuesday morning.

I walked out of the WTC just minutes (probably 8 minutes) after the plane slammed into the first tower.

As I got out of the PATH train (which runs through the bowels of the WTC) I could smell something burning. There is a restaurant at the same level and I thought they must have had a minor accident. Sure enough, the fire alarm lights were blinking. People usually ignore these lights as these are a frequent occurrence. Of course, people at the restaurant were ignoring the alarm.

I took the escalator that takes me to street level. As we approached that level, I suddenly saw people on the escalator above me running away; there was a great deal of commotion and shouting. I thought it must be a hostage situation and dashed toward the exit I usually take. I saw a man being supported by a policeman. It looked like he was bleeding. I assumed he had been shot and took off like a mad man. I slowed down when I realised that all the shops around me were closed -- and the scene outside the glass door some 50 feet before me was a little murky. There appeared to be some smoke outside. I wasn't sure what was happening.

I walked to the exit and stepped out. It looked like a scene from a war movie. The street looked like a war zone. I immediately drew parallels to Beirut. Then another thing struck me -- the smell of burning had not gone away at all! How could a restaurant fire deep down smell all the way up here? I wondered. Then I saw the debris all around me -- some of it was still burning. I chanced to look up -- then the horror of it dawned on me. The WTC was burning! I whipped out my cell phone and tried to call my wife. No signal. Obviously everyone around me was using up the cell sites -- not enough network bandwidth to get my call through.

Usually I turn right and go to my office. But the way towards my office appeared to be impassable. There was just too much debris there. So I crossed the road in front of me and then turned right to my office. Still no go. There was a police officer blocking my path. I stopped. But several others pushed through. He told me the only way was to go one block and then try to turn right. I did just that. That road had debris. I was pushing along when I saw -- right in front of me -- a huge hunk of what appeared to be freshly hewn beef sitting on the windshield of a car. I was shocked! What kind of person would store freshly cut meat -- even temporarily when taking it out of a truck and putting it into cold storage -- on the hood of a car? Just then a couple of people put a sheet of white cloth on that. Then I heard some women screaming and pointing to something below. I looked down, and a scant six inches from my foot I saw a foot.

I managed to cross the highway that separates my office from the WTC. I struggled up a small embankment and watched as people poured out of my office building. I still did not know that a plane had crashed into the WTC. Then I heard someone say so. I just did not believe him. I thought to myself, this is a small fire -- these people should be able to contain it quite easily. Why would my building be in danger? I walked up to the security staff at my building and asked them if they were planning to evacuate the building. They said 'Not yet, but it could be any moment.' Decision time. Should I go up or go home? I decided foolhardily to go up. Since I work on the sixth floor -- any emergency exit would not be quite as painful as, say, an exit from the 38th floor (which is where I used to work). I pressed on up, took the first elevator.

Just as I got off the elevator, I saw a couple of people rushing out of an adjacent office, saying they had just seen a second plane hitting 'our' building. Oh no! All I wanted to do at that time was call my wife and tell her I was coming home. I opened my office -- which I share with three others -- dialed home, only to find that I could not get through. I dialled again. In the meantime I heard the people on my floor rushing to the emergency door. I managed to get through to my wife and told her the WTC was burning, that there had been another plane crash and that I was trying to return home. Then I left.

I was the last person on my floor to leave. As I wended my way down the stairs I was struck by how calm people were. This New York resilience is something I saw time and time again today. We left the building and I got out -- now I realised the second plane had slammed into the other WTC tower. Someone standing by said to me he had seen the plane coming from near the Statue of Liberty and slamming into the tower.

I kept turning back to see what was happening. I saw at least three or four people jumping from what must have been the 40th or 50th floor of the WTC tower. They were flying out only to slam into concrete -- which I fortunately did not witness. They were obviously jumping from the fire and willing to take a chance with the jump. I was horrified. I looked at the pavement below me and saw many, many empty high heeled shoes. Did they come from the explosion? Not possible because they were all in pairs and undamaged. Then I got it -- this must have been people watching while the second plane crashed into the building.

By now I was numb. It was almost 9:15 am. Or 9.20 am. I wasn't looking at my watch. I saw a few people with digital cameras taking videos and pictures of the building going up in flames. I kept walking until I reached a subway station I knew existed. I got into the subway numb with shock and escaped from the area.

I got off the subway at 14th street and 4th Avenue and trudged all the way up to 33rd street and 8th Avenue. A mighty long walk, considering that each street takes about a minute at a brisk pace and each Avenue takes about 4 minutes. I reached Penn station at around 10 am. I got into what would be the exit train for me, the 10:43 am going home. Unfortunately they evacuated Penn station so I had to wait outside for about four hours before ultimately reaching home by the same train around 3:30 pm.

I am glad to be alive. I hope and pray the thousands of souls that died there today go to heaven in peace. It was never their fault. It never is.

*'''Location:''' Quezon City, Philippines&lt;br&gt;
*'''Reaction:''' WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENIN!!!???&lt;br&gt;

It was Tuesday Evening here in our country, and I had just finished my hw. in school.
Time for me to relax so I went to my chair, got the remote and started clicking on the channels. Suddenly, I saw on CNN,that both Twin towers are on fire!!! The first thing that came into my mind was just an accident from above maybe an electrical current got short and caused fire or the stove was left and began burning all the things nearby or a computer exploded or whatever minor accidents. But when I thought about it, I realized if it's that minor, why would it be featured in CNN , an international news channel, or why is the fire so big? And the reporter just said that two hijacked planes crashed on the towers. I called my mom, my brothers and sisters to check out the news. My mother even questioned me if that's a movie or a spoof! We could NOT believe what just had happened and we just sat together watching on the news with horror in our eyes. 20 minutes later, our uncle called who was a steward for the Philippine Airlines who just got back from a flight in US, and told us that our father WORKED there! ( on the 21st floor in the north tower ). I know it may sound strange knowing only where our father works but to straighten things up, we just knew it because he was got a work job in NY since moving from LA, he lives in NJ together with my other relatives and goes to NY to work. Anyway, to get back on our unforgettable to what seems to be a horror movie, we all knew that our father migrated to the US and worked there, and 1 of a hundred filipinos working in the towers itself!  Our eyes were full of confusion, grief horror, hearts sank deeply on the ground trying to build a grave out of our blood, and asked ourselves, &quot;of all the things that could be done, WHY THIS?&quot; We all waited for the telephone to ring, hoping our father will call uninjured. And an hour later, one of the towers collapsed! I can't believe it! And I was really expecting a great loss of life there!!! Even though I am about 12,343,213 miles from there, I can feel the horror!
And later BOTH TOWERS COLLAPSED!!! Our father still in our minds and hoping he's still alive.
It was 11.00pm here in the Philippines when both towers collapsed. I can't believe it, it was really true, it says on the tv LIVE! I didn't want to sleep that terrible night, but my body cant handle it and I prayed and I prayed wishing my father'll still be alive and I suddenly slept on the chair. I woke up at 5:00 am in the morning our time to prepare for school, and at last my mother talked to my father and he said he was safe. All those anxieties are finally gone but I thought about the people still waiting for their loved ones . I felt very sorry for them and the Sept. 11, incident will forever be sealed in my mind.

Papa, if you are reading this right now, I just want to tell you that I love you and I dont want to lose you!...

My mom called me and woke me up about 10 AM EST. I didn't have to be at work early, so I was sleeping in. I answered the phone and she said to turn on the TV, they attacked New York. I put on CNN and watched the planes hit the buildings over and over again.

I drove to work, but we didn't work. We sat on the couch in my boss' living room, switching back and forth between Headline News and CNN and all the other channels. It didn't matter which one, they were all showing the same thing over and over. From different angles. From a tourist's camcorder, with a guy saying, &quot;HOLY SHIT!&quot; as the first plane hits. The people running from the dust cloud as the building collapses. Over and over.

We went out to lunch, everyone numbed, talked about driving to New York to help.  No idea how, we just wanted to do something. I bought a book from the shop next door to the restaurant, and boss' wife was shocked that I could think of shopping right now. The extremely neat man with the affected lisp who ran the shop asked me what her problem was, and I told him that she's upset about the whole planes flying into buildings thing and doesn't see how I can think of shopping. He shrugged and said something to the effect of, &quot;well, life goes on.&quot;

We drove by the blood donation place, but the line of cars was so long we couldn't even get close. We got some beer, all sat around and drank in front of the TV.

My boss and I would occasionally make sardonic remarks about whatever news footage or talking head was on TV, much to his wife's chagrin. There was footage of an unexplained fire in Kabul. A military spokesman was asked about the fire; he responded, &quot;We have a number of contingency plans ready for any eventuality.&quot; Boss commented, &quot;One of those contingency plans being, 'bomb Afghanistan'.&quot; I laughed. His wife was horrified that we could find levity in anything.

I went to bed that night horrified that there could be people so evil in the world who could do such a thing. Horrified at the ignorant rednecks who were going around blowing the heads off of Middle Eastern gas station owners in calm retribution. Every time I think I've seen the worst of humanity, I find out that there's more.

''Freiburg, Germany'' (tillwe)

In the afternoon (local time, which is morning in the US), I was learning for my exam sitting in front of my computer in my room. In a break, I switched on some online news and was absolutly shocked by seeing the news on WTC. The next hours I tried to find every information I could about the incident, talking to friends and family. A friend of mine was visiting the USA then, and only three days latter I found out she was well. As it became known that the Pentagon was hit, too, my thought was that the US, wounded as they felt, would react immidiatly military (which didn't happen, what I didn't know then). The next morning I woke with the thought the world may be in WW III, in a big clash-of-civilization-like scenario.

Washington, DC

At the time, I was commuting to work from Baltimore to Washington every morning on the train. That particular morning, I woke up feeling very disoriented and generally very weird. I ended up missing my train. Once I boarded the next train an hour later, I quickly fell asleep. I woke up and overheard a woman talking about a plane flying into a building. Still half-asleep, I figured they were talking about a new Schwarzenegger movie, and went back to sleep. Next time I woke up, people were crying and trying to get cell phone calls out. This time I stayed awake. One woman on my train was an employee of the WTC in Baltimore, and was trying to reach her collegues in New York. One person who got through on his phone announced that DC was under attack, and that the Pentagon was bombed and the National Mall was on fire. We were stunned for a minute, and wondered if Union Station was be the best place to be if the city was being attacked. 

We finally got there, and were quickly ushered out of the station. Being miles away from my office, I trepidatiously boarded the Metro at the next station over. I met up with my boss outside of my office, and found out what really happened. Hoards of people were in the street - every building in the city had been evacuated. We walked to the bus station. Along the way, entire streets had been blocked off because of bomb threats. My boss drove me home, because none of the trains were running. 

I was really struck by how brave people were, and how people were supporting each other throughout the day, despite how devestated everyone felt inside. I don't remember much of the next week or so, except that I cried and prayed a lot.

El Segundo, CA

I?m a licensed private pilot, and my recollection of September 11th 2001 and the days immediately following turns largely on how those events affected aviation.

The grounding of all aircraft flying in the United States airspace was unprecedented.  But that?s what the FAA ordered on that morning, when it became obvious that the crashes of commercial airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and into the ground in Pennsylvania, were not accidental.  

My husband and I live near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and there?s a constant stream of air traffic arriving at and departing from LAX.  In daylight hours you can see them arriving, spaced in some cases only moments apart, a carefully-choreographed dance that brings the aircraft down onto LAX?s four runways.  At night you can see the chain of airplanes like a chain of glittering diamonds shining in the night as the arriving traffic is formed up into a line in trail for landing at the airport.

Well, as my husband and I drove down Hawthorne Boulevard to work on the morning of September 11th, there were no aircraft in the sky at all.  Nothing was arriving at LAX.  Nothing was departing.  The sky was empty and silent, eerily so.

The grounding continued for several days, the FAA re-opening the airspace only gradually, first to commercial flights.  One of my recollections of that time was watching a 747 flying a tight pattern to land at LAX the second or third day after the 11th.  This was the first aircraft I?d seen land since the 11th.  

The Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) (the business entity that rented me the aircraft I flew and provided other services to me and to other private pilots) that I flew with was in a world of hurt because of the flight restrictions.  Because of fears, all unfounded, that terrorists might try to use small private aircraft to carry out further attacks against the United States, the FAA was loath to allow private non-commercial aircraft to resume flying within crowded metropolitan areas.  This meant that those who depended for their livelihood on aircraft rentals, sales of fuel, and other services to the private pilot community were badly hurt by the flight ban.  Aviation businesses are mostly a labor of love;  the way you make a small fortune in aviation is by starting with a large one.  Every FBO in the metropolitan LA area that was covered by the flight ban was hurting.  

That?s what I remember most about the events of 9/11 that directly impacted me:  the way the people who depended on aviation to make a living were hurt by the flight ban.  To me, many of these people represent another sort of casualty of the attacks:  the businesses and people who were hurt financially (in some cases hurt so badly they never recovered) by actions growing out of the aftermath of 9/11.

Silent skies and the silent, unseen despair of the people who lived by aviation were the aftermath of the attacks.

I'm a 14 year old from small town Houghton, Michigan. And although this terrible event happened 2 years ago, I remember it like it was just yesterday. 
I found out what had happened while I was in my Aspects of Sports class. Normally that class is terribly boring, and Mr. Powell said he was going to turn on the TV, so I was happy to hear that. 

I watched as they showed the footage of the first plane hitting the tall structure. Then out of nowhere the second plane hit. Just then I felt a horrible shock run through my body...

After we all saw what had happened, Mr. Powell turned off the TV. We had a short discussion about the sickening events that had just taken place. For the rest of the school day we kept asking teachers to turn on the TV's to see what happened, but they weren't allowed. They weren't even allowed to talk about it. 

When school was over I got home fast as I could and turned on the TV. Then I heard the shocking news.. both buildings had collapsed. And another plane had hit the Pentagon. 

As soon as I heard that the buildings had fallen I remembered that I had friends in New York. 

I knew 5 people who worked in building 1. Only 2 are alive now to tell their story. 

R.I.P. guys.

I was 32, my mother said me I had to go to the dinning room for eat a spanish omelet (two egs with potatoes, all mixed) and lettuce. My father was watching the TV, the afternoon news. Then I saw how the second plane impact the tower, I look to my father (rare, because I hate him) and I said: &quot;They are crazy&quot;, while I smile slightly. I finished my omelette and I went to my room for watching all the TV channels. Most of them was showing the live images. Then the towers fell...it was serious. Today I still think it was a TV joke because
the live images and people reactions were like a Spielberg film. The new world order must prevent all those TV shows, most people is not prepared for judge heavy metal music.

Sincerely,

Antonio (Spain)

Bucharest, Romania 

I came here as a Peace Corps Volunteer in 1998. My mother and I had a silly fight in July, 2001, and she stopped speaking to me... one Tuesday in September I gathered my courage and called home, around 4:15 p.m. Romania time. My father said, &quot;Are you calling because of what's happened?&quot; 

&quot;No, I'm calling to talk to Mom. Why, what happened?&quot; 

&quot;Planes just hit the Twin Towers. We're under attack.&quot; 

This seemed so unreal that I said &quot;Oh&quot; and asked to talk to Mom (who refused to take the phone, btw). After that I went downstairs to a neighbor's who had a TV, and it was only then that I realized how serious things were. 

I wear a memorial bracelet with the names of two Romanians who died on 9-11, Alexandru Stan and his wife Corina. They won the visa lottery, emigrated to the States, and got jobs at the WTC.

Light at the end of the tunnel
Local man begins to find peace after nightmare of 9/11
By Kathy Manetti

For many Americans, every day since September 11, 2001 has been a struggle just to simply get out of bed and trudge along in the normal rhythm of life. What happened that day marred our vision of a safe and sane world, and life as we knew it, would never be the same.
Jeff Seide of Weston has certainly had his share of nightmares, since that fateful morning, when he sat at his desk atop the 84th floor of WTC 2. ?I just knew,? stated Mr. Seide, recalling his instinctive reaction to leave the building after the first plane had struck tower 1. ?Having been a 1993 Trade Center veteran, I just knew this was very serious and so I just yelled for everybody to get out.?
An employee of Tradesoft / Euro Brokers, a Bond Brokerage company that lost 61 employees that day, Jeff rallied many of his coworkers to leave the building.
?I was eye level with the explosion in Tower 1, the wall was engulfed with flames. Black smoke and debris billowed out of the building. I knew I had to get out of there. There were others that weren?t so sure.?
As Mr. Seide and a large number of fellow workers streamed down the stairwell, fear seemed to grip their every move. More and more people seemed to have received that same instinctive message and poured into the stairwell for escape. 
?When I was on or about the 35th floor, there was a second blast,? said Mr. Seide. ?This time, the building shook, and the lights dimmed for awhile.? Little did he know that at this time, his entire office building (floors 79-84) had been seared through by the second plane.
&lt;The nightmare worsens&gt;
What ensued for the next few hours was a daze of smoke, primal fear, and a close up view of death. After being directed uptown for a few minutes, he decided to retrace his steps and head back to retrieve his car that was in parked in the Battery Garage. As he attempted to escape, he soon noticed that all the roads were closed and traffic was at a standstill.
?As I was standing outside of my car gazing at the burning towers I suddenly heard a bang. It was the tower collapsing. The sound was shocking. Like a deck of cards, I watched floor after floor as if in slow-motion falling to the ground.?
People were running and screaming as an enormous black cloud enveloped the entire financial district.
?I recall thinking that I was testing fate for the second time that day.  Like the others, I darted into the park, briefly ducking behind a tree and hoping that I wouldn?t be a victim of flying glass, much like the body I stepped over just minutes before.? 
As the cloud of black smoke encircled him, he found himself running toward the water, among a sea of hysterical people struggling for their lives. Finding a resting spot for his trembling legs, he waited for what seemed like hours until he saw a spot of sun in the black sky and he knew that the wind was drafting the cloud out to sea. This encouraged him onward, back into his car. Hours later, he was in the arms of his loving family.
Unsure of the number of lives that he helped to save that day, Mr. Seide is certain of only one thing? it was his faith that has helped him to deal with the horrific pain that came from experiencing such devastation.
?It?s all about faith. I don?t know how anyone can get through something like this without God.?
He encourages people to stop and listen. ?This was our wake-up call. Regardless of your religion/denomination, it?s essential to benefit from this disaster and renew ones devotion.?
&lt; A humble hero&gt;
Heralded a hero by those whose lives he saved through his quick thinking and proactive resolve to leave Mr. Seide was most touched by his wife Cindi and their four children, whose view of that day was very clear. Chad, the oldest, sent him a special message that he read at the service.
?Dad, last year I almost lost you. Before the 11th I never even thought of something like that happening. Within moments my life changed. You are a hero. You have shown more strength that I can ever have, and I hope that one day I can be like you. You have a family that loves and cares about you more than you can imagine. Today is not only a day of reflection, but a day to remember how fragile life is. I am grateful to have a family that cares. My love for you all surpasses words. I am 3000 miles away, but you are always on my mind?
&lt;The memory lives on&gt; Love, Jeff

I'm Alex Wright, I'm now 17, and like in Liss, a village in [[en:Hampshire]] near the town of Petersfield and a half-hour train ride from the city of [[en:Portsmouth]], in South [[en:England]]. On Tuesday, September 11, 2001 I was a 14-year-old schoolboy. I'd come home from my secondary school at about 3pm and bought a book for my English class ([[en:Lord of the Flies]]) before going to my mum's shop. I remember I first heard about it when a friend of mine came into my mum's shop in Petersfield babbling something about a warzone in New York. I didn't know what he was on about and laughed because I thought he was joking. That made me rembember later that loads of people had been watchoing TV when I walked past a pub. I was very annoyed I didn't have a radio with me, I went into my mum's office and looked at the low graphics BBC News site excrutiatingly slow Web connection. Then I remembered a local shop had a TV showing Sky News. When in there I saw a man walk in, see the TV, and freeze. The really freaking think is my dad has visited New York and the World Trade Center before so if thinks had gone differently.
I've now realised 9/11 was probably a sort-of turning point in my life. Obviously not in the profound, devastating way that it would be for victims. Although I had read a bit on the Internet about the African embassy bombings trials and was opposed to the death penalty, but I'm sure I don't remember being as interested in politics as I am now, or as passionate about things like the Palestinian and Chechen causes (i don't think I knew much about them at all then), or so against war crimes and terrorism against civilians whoever has done it. I had a shock a few months ago when I was looking at the 9/11 In Memorandam Tributes to victims list. The youngest victim of 9/11 was a two and a half year old baby girl, [[Christine Hanson]] of Groton, Massachussetts, on her way to Disneyland with her parents on one of the planes. How could any murder a two-year-old baby girl?

'''Julius''', from Amsterdam (not the New Amsterdam, the old original, in The Netherlands)

In our time the events took place around tea-time, people were wide-awake and we all fully experienced it right away. I had the day off from work, I remember it was a strange day, even before the news hit me. Somehow, looking back at it, I must have felt some type of eery tension I couldn't really put my fingers on until it all started. It was a sunny day here as well. I was at my dentist about an hour before the first plane hit the WTC, for annual inspection, but he needed to do a lot of clean-up so it wasn't a pleasant experience. Away from the dentist I stepped in our city-subway (metro) and took a ride to the Amstelstation, I remember looking out of the window during the ride, thinking how strangely wild the weather appeared to be getting all of a sudden. I was determined to buy a set of speakers at RAF HiFi in the Rijnstraat, since they were having a bargain sales week or something. I must have been inside the store, checking out some speakers, for 5 minutes when I heard some loud dutch cursing from the front-side-room of the store, where some TV-set was tuned in on CNN. I went there to look what the fuss was all about, customers as well as the entire sales crew were walking towards the same room where the TV-sets were. Walking in I remember people all looking at the same large screen with shock beaming from their eyes and their mouths open, some were explaining each other what fragments others had just missed. My first words in the room were: &quot;Is this for real?&quot; (in dutch) Yes, this was no movie, these were no special effects. several unknown people replied. So I added &quot;but.. this is New York, right?&quot;. Someone was tuning a third TV-set to yet another station. I was somewhat flabbergasted and numb about it, just couldn't really believe this, I thought I was having some bad dream, wanted to go home fast and check it out in detail on my own TV. In the midst of all the turmoil I managed to buy the speakerset I had my eyes on. They were small, but the boxes were quite large, and I had to carry them all the way home. I had to take a tram. It was really full of people when I stepped in. People inside the tram were talking about it, you know, it's strange how events like this bring people together in cities. I recall standing in that packed tram with my speakers (all seats were taken) thinking there are so many similarities between New York City and Amsterdam, people were feeling really uncomfortable about it, New York is very close to us, we love that city, we grew up with it, pretty much, if not from TV or movies, then from being so much alike. This is a freedom loving city as well, with a lot of anonymous humans, all living in their own mini cosmos. I have lots of american friends whom I worried about since most live in NYC. These were weird minutes, some people could barely hold themselves together, public transportation is tense enough as it is when it's the busy hours, full of people trying not to lose their minds. I could tell this news caused and extra tension in that tram. Half of the people knew, the other half learned about it right then and there. &quot;you're joking, right?&quot; &quot;No, I'm not.&quot; &quot;No he isn't!&quot; another anonymous person added. Slowly it sinked in, this was all really happening. Traffic outside the tram was panicky as well. More people were honking their horns than usual. Impatient, shocked. Walking from the tram to my home was grim, it was getting clouded, I was carrying the weight of the speaker-boxes as fast as I could. Inside I dumped the boxes on the floor and ran towards my TV's power-button, had a coat on that I didn't put off for at least an hour, as I sat there frozen in front of my TV holding the remote control in both my hands. As I understood what had happened some more I managed to ease down a little, and noticed that my answering machine blinked with 4 messages. I played them, friends were warning me about the news, &quot;woah.. put on CNN! NOW!.. you will not believe your eyes!&quot;. I stayed in all evening, skipped everything else, watched the news from everywhere, went to chat and e-mail with parents and friends on the web about it. I missed that one girl I was in love with, wondered where she was, what she was thinking. I truly felt pain, anyone touching New York New York is touching me personally. I knew this would change life as we knew it back then. And it sure did...

Whitehaven, Cumbria, England

In 2001 I had just started to study my A-levels at my local secondary school.  Being so early on in the school year, there wasn't much work to be done outside of class hours, so this was generally spent wandering around the sixth-form and library areas. At lunch a friend and me went to see who we could find hanging around.  About one o'clock (UK time) we walked into the library to find two friends of ours.  One - who studied English Literature and was sat with a writing pad in front of her, pen in hand - turned and said &quot;have you heard the news?&quot;.  Of course, we'd been at school all morning, so we hadn't heard much about anything and said no.  &quot;A plane's crashed into a world trade building&quot; came the response.  Thinking she was writing a story we didn't really believe this.  &quot;Yeah?&quot; and &quot;Really?&quot; came our responses, &quot;you're just writing a story&quot; was the third.  &quot;No, seriously, they've got the TV on round there, go have a look.&quot;  So we went to see.......how wrong were we?  On BBC news 24, they were looping the picture of the first plane crashing.  WE sat and watched it through our free period, then went to our last lesson, where it was all that was being talked about.
At home, it was on the TV all night, total devastation everywhere...
Although I didn’t know anyone that was injured or killed, I feel for the people that did, and am totally shocked by this action.

Texas, USA

I was 18. On the morning of September 11th, I was going to an event in our local civic center, a food expo for my high school hospitality class. I was listening to a morning show on my car radio, and they were letting a young, new artist (I think it was Michelle Branch) play her song on the show to help her get publicity. When that song ended, everything changed. The main DJ politely thanked her, then informed the audience that they hadn't wanted to interrupt the girl's song, but that something terrible had happened. An airplane had crashed into the WTC. With that statement, they had to cut to commercial break. I can remember driving along, thinking, &quot;What...? What a terrible joke to tell, that's not funny at all! They shouldn't joke about something like that!&quot; When they came back from commercial, they began to give more of the details as they knew them, and all I could think was, &quot;This must be joke, it has to be.&quot; But they never started laughing. It was real. I parked my car at the civic center, but I couldn't go in. I thought to myself what a terrible accident it was, what a strange thing to happen. And then they said that a second plane had hit. There is no coincidence like that. It was intentional. One of the DJs began to cry as he reported, and I broke down with him. Eventually, I gathered myself up and went inside to the food event. I met up with my class and we asked each other in hushed voices, &quot;Did you hear about the airplanes?&quot; It didn't seem real at all. It was so distant and numb. We had a good time at the food fair, putting airplanes out of our minds as if that would make it disappear, but as time went on, everyone's heart became heavier. I went on back to school where the reaction was much the same. Numb shock. One of my teachers and many fellow students made bizarre jokes, trying to joke it out of existence too. I crawled into my car after classes and cried harder than I had before... my Dad was away on a business trip, and I didn't know where. That part made it even worse -- I hadn't even cared to ask where he was going. Once I went to work, I found out to my great relief that he was alright, only stuck far away because of the groundings. For the first time that day I saw the footage because my boss had brought up his tv so we could see. That's when it was really real. For weeks afterward, I kept dreaming about blood flowing from the side of the Statue of Liberty. For me and so many people around me, all sense of safety was suddenly stripped away. Our beautiful nation had been so badly hurt, when I had thought that nothing could ever really hurt America. Buildings just aren't demolished in instants. Thousands just aren't supposed to be killed in the blink of an eye. My strangest memory from the entire event is about Jane Eyre. My English teacher had assigned this book for us, and had set us at a pretty vigorous reading pace. The night of Sept 11 I was reading Jane Eyre because I had to, and I had never been angrier in my life. It felt like nothing mattered but what was happening right now. How I had treated the people I loved who could have died like those thousands. How little the day-to-day worries really mattered. How little it mattered what political party someone was, or whether someone had insulted me a week before. We were alive.

A letter home on 9/11/01 by ''Szuki''

I took the early train into NY this morning and was ensconcend in my
office at One Liberty Plaza, across the street from the World Trade
Center by 7:15.  Had to prep for a presentation at 9, right after a
departmental call at 8.  It was sunny and clear, promising to get up
to 80.

As the departmental meeting was wrapping up, we felt a shake and a
bang.  Sounded to me to be withing the parameters of normal NY city
noise, but the speaker on the call (possibly on the other side of our
building) interpreted it as an explosion.  And he was right.

Look out any window, and you saw papers fluttering down - not the
small stuff you see when the yankees win - big sheets of various
colors along with bits of ceiling tile -- falling like heavy rain on a
beautiful morning.  Crane your neck up though, and the damage was
unmistakable.  Fire, smoke and burned out windows on the north tower
of the world trade center.  Still raining litter.

We were instructed to move to the other side of the building, and stay
away from windows.  Most of us called home.  Cell phones were still
working.  From the behind an emergency exit door, I could hear people
running down the stairwells to the lobby.  We stayed put.  Lights
still on, no smoke visible anywhere near us.  I gathered my knapsack
and cell phone -we were anxious but not panicky.  Grabbed the scooter
too - no telling when or how I was going to get home.

Second explosion shakes our building.  Soon the instructions changed -
we are to leave the building.  So down we go.  On the other side of
the double stairwell, two colleagues are helping a very pregnant third
colleague down the stairs.  Our eyes met as we rounded the stairs at
each landing, and at each floor the sense of urgency is growing.  Can
I help - no, capable people are helping her.  Near the bottom, we
heard that the cause was not an accident, and that the second
explosion was not gas -- instead it seems that twice the towers have
been hit by terrorists.  This thing now seems to have no limits - what
other landmarks might attract Osama or Saddam?

Ground level - thank god no trampling or panic of that sort.  On the
street it is fairly chaotic.  I notice the litter.  I notice a
photograph of two men - business types - taken in London with one of
the queen's guard in the background.  This photo has fallen three
blocks away from the tower now spewing smoke.  This represents to me a
somebody's life snuffed out.  I can't drop the picture, and fold it
into my pocket, and now I am very sad.

Amulances, police cars of all sorts, come streaming and screaming down
the avenue to the WTC.  A huge bus brisling with antennas, labelled
&quot;metropolitan crisis command center&quot; com hurtling down the avenue.
Naturally a cab or two follow in the wake of the last emergency
vehicle.

I met another colleague, who takes the same commuter train, and we
struck out together to try to get home on the other side of the river.
I figure the PATH train that terminates in the WTC is a bad bet.  The
ferry that terminates there is also not likely to be running.  Subways
will be iffy.  So best to hoof it.  We aim for the PATH station in
Greenwich Village, seeking the side streets, away from large buildings
and away from landmarks (police plaza, the courts where the other WTC
terrorists might have been tried).  At every corner  we can look back
at the two towers, still standing, spewing smoke and some fire, like
huge roman candles.  Now the north side of number 2 is visible, and
the hole seems quite small, and does not have any sort of airplane
shape to it.  There are still boundaries to this thing - just two
buildings and they are only damaged in the upper floors.

Thank god the PATH train is running and guess what, it's a free ride.
To Hoboken we go, slowly, and when we arrive I hurry to the commuter
train platforms.  It seems they have wisely set up one long train on
each line.  I hop aboard and begin to hear the stories from the other
passengers, one of whom has a big dirty smear on his forehead.  All
are healthy.

First shock is that the Pentagon was also hit.  This thing is getting
bigger and bigger....  Now it seems that the second tower was also hit
by an airplane - a commercial flight at that (definintely a United
plane)!  One guy tells his story that includes the first really gory
bits - he has seen body parts, hands and legs, four blocks from the
WTC.  (And it was a TWA flight.)    A guy monitoring his news-spewing
beeper says that there was a third plane - but this is not confirmed
(airline not mentioned).

Now the towers have collapsed they say.  We talk about Pearl Harbor.
They were lucky since the bad guys were flying clearly marked planes.
Who could have done this?  August 11 - things are going to change.
Just the thing for a stalled economy?  Going to be a lot of funerals
in Montclair.  How many could have been killed??  Are there traders
even now loading up on defence stocks?

Remember the metropolitan disaster command center bus?  It is probably
buried under the rubble.

The train will depart, they say, when it is full.   Gives us time to
walk to the head of the train and look at the huge cloud of smoke
about a mile away - so dense that nothing at all of the towers are
visible.  But there must be something.  I am afraid that it will be
nothing more than a very large pile of rubble.  The smoke trails is
probably visible from Spacelab, streaming off towards the south Jersey
shore.  Obscuring, I might add, the statue of liberty (something
poetic there.)

How are my friends doing?  One works in number 2 WTC.  One was on the
street when it happened and left me a message.  How many others are in
that mess?

From the station hear sirens and turn to see ambulances, tons of them,
from Kinnelon, Montville, Florham Park - these are communities an
hours drive from NYC - streaming into downtown Manhattan to help.

At the home train station, people look for friends, and news is shared
about who works in the WTC, who is accounted for, who is not.  The
woman that Jerry was worried about is here, and they embrace - she is
getting teary, and says she's okay until she tries to talk.  She was
in the World financial center just across from 1 WTC, and has had a
hard time of it.

A short ride home, down green tree lined streets and beautiful homes.
Is this what they want to destroy?  How will this street change?  How
will we change?

This is a very sad day first for the vicitms and their families,
second for the many more who will die in the fight that is sure to
come.  Suddenly the future looks a bit iffy.

I remember what I was doing. I was skipping class and attempting to get off school property unnoticed when a friend came up with a discman and said 'listen to this!'. So I did. Then I went down to the smoke pit and sat in plain view of the teachers/administration and used the incident as an excuse to skip class without repercusions while I listened to the radio off and on (not the news) and smoked cigarettes.

The previous night had been a late one.  I had spent most of the night working on my first code patch for the nascent [[en:Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] project, and only made it to bed at around four in the morning.  At seven, my mother came into my room and woke me, saying something about planes crashing into buildings in New York&amp;mdash;the exact words are lost to me four years later.  I don't think they knew yet that terrorists had done it.

I got out of bed and wandered downstairs to see what was going on, and ended up being captured by the TV.  I saw the first tower collapse, and I remember hoping that maybe the second would cling to the sky, but that was not to be; it followed its sister to the ground.  I don't know if I realized there were still people in those buildings when they fell.

At some point, I had to go to school; it was my first day in a new independent study program.  I don't remember much of what I did that day, but I do remember standing outside, waiting for my ride home to arrive, staring at the half-mast flag and trying to memorize the date and my grade and age; I understood at the time that this would be something people would talk about for the rest of my life.

From Buena Park, California

I first heard about the attacks a little bit after six in the morning pacific time.  I was washing sleeping when my mom knocked on the door and said that a plane had just hit the World Trade Center.  The term World Trade Center didn’t mean anything to me at the time and I actually pictured in my mind the Empire State Building.  As for the plane, I was not picturing a jet liner either.  I was thinking of one of the small propeller planes that flew over my house all the time dangling out of the Empire State Building.  No fire, no smoke, no chaos.

So I didn’t exactly hurry out of bed even though my mom had told me to come quickly.  I rationalized that plane crashes happened all the time, not a big deal.  I would soon learn how much of a big deal it was.  That time in my bedroom was the last time I would ever live without a fear of America being attacked; I suppose you could say 10 September was my last day of innocence and America’s too.

So when I got out of the bath and saw the television screen I was truly amazed.  I had not imagined a great ball of fire or all the smoke.  What I imagined in my bed was totally and utterly wrong.  The truth was that this was no ordinary plane crash, which was apparent because both towers were hit.  So I tried to get ready for my second day of fifth grade the best I could despite the conditions of the morning.  Normally, I would watch the news so that I wouldn’t be distracted by cartoons in the morning, but not that day.  That day I couldn’t and watched Nickelodeon instead.

The only thing I remember of that morning at home after eating breakfast was walking past the television with CNN on it while carrying my laundry to the kitchen where the washing machine was.  It was then that the first tower collapsed.  I watched in awe and was intrigued by how it looked like a fountain of water, all the dust and smoke pluming down.
	
When I got to school that morning one thing that amazed me was that nobody was talking about it.  Only one person came up to me and asked, “Did you see the news?” I said, “Yes,” and that was the end of the conversation.  I think now that they were just as scared as I.  In the class room however, though nobody wanted to talk about the attacks, everybody wanted to know about them so the teacher would turn on the news for about five minutes an hour so we could see what was going on.  It wasn’t good.

Later that day or maybe even a couple of days after (it all just kind of blends together) we had assembly where the school principal basically reassured as all that we would be fine.  It sure didn’t work with me.  For weeks after I seriously thought that I was going to die.  I had never felt fear like that before and haven’t since.  The fear gradually faded away though I was still afraid for months of going to public places.  Gradually, as my fear melted, great anger arose.
 
After this the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq occurred, the former of which I have no memorably strong feelings about other than that I thought it was correct and the latter I do not even want to touch on due to the controversy surrounding it.

I haven't found the right place for prayer in the story of September 11th.  As an Englishman the recent bombings in London have brought the World Trade Centre attacks clearly into mind.  My thoughts and those of many religous and Christian people have been and are with the victims of the attacks and all those affected by them.  The challenge, looking back, seems to be: How can we live together as humans without turning to hate?  It seems to me that we have to look to exemplars of understanding and non-violence, like [[en:Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]].  May we all live together in peace.

'''Los Angeles, California''' - LAX area

On Sept. 11th, I was the Security Director for a hotel in the LAX area.  I had stayed up late the previous nite and was sound asleep when I receive a call in the morning, waking me up, saying &quot;You're not at the hotel?  Didn't they call you in?  Don't you know what's going on?  Turn on the TV!&quot;  I sat and stared, completely numb.  I couldn't believe it.  My first instinct was to call the hotel.  Everything's ok I was told, you don't have to come in early.  I sat glued to the television for a whole five minutes when I was called by the hotel and told, &quot;get in here right away&quot;.  The adrenaline started to kick in and as I drove down Lincoln Blvd. past the airport, I saw the eerie sight of absolutley no air traffic.  Becaue I barely had time to watch tv, I didn't know they had stopped all air traffic.  That was the first thing I heard from the staff as I entered the hotel.  Oh my God, I thought, we have airline crew who stay here........and I wondered.  One of the flights crew (details withheld out of respect) had indeed stayed at our hotel, and the Front Desk staff was pretty traumatized.  Then the realization hit that everyone who was due to depart that day wouldn't be able to, including the crews from 4 different airlines.  In the hotel lounge, the TV was glued to CNN.  Groups of guests and airline crews were huddled in little groups.  We tried to help them as best we could.......free phone calls, giving them cell phone chargers left in lost &amp; found, communicating with the airlines.  They were clearly in shock, many were crying.  We had a manager's meeting and found out that one of the hotels destroyed in Manhattan was from our company.  Fellow employees were missing.    An announcement was made that they were closing the airport.  I will never in my life forget the images of passengers walking down Century Blvd, suitcases in tow, looking for hotels with rooms.  Several employees now could not get to work because they were closing all roads leading into and out of the airport area.  It was going to be a long day.  Now the trouble started.  The media was swarming all over the place.  We made the decision to restrict hotel access to employees and guests only.  Tons of reporters were trying to get in.  I had the unpleasant task of telling them they had to leave.  I was called more than a few names, told I was infringing on constitutional rights, and other such garbage.  I was just trying to protect our guests.  A reporter then snuck in, found her way to the bar, then pulled a video camera out of her coat, (no one wears a coat in LA in Sept) and shoves the camera in the face of an obviously distraught airline employee.  I informed the reporter that I would physically remove her if she didn't leave.  All together, we had to remove almost 30 reporters that day.  Now, in Aug. of 05, I still dream about Sept. 11, but as if it is happening in LA.  What I don't understand, is that the dreams are becoming more vivid and more frequent.  I always wonder why I would be having more nightmares, not less.  A portention of the future?  I had another dream last night.  I am going to Manhattan on a trip next week.  My heart goes out to the people of New York.  I wonder how they survived such trauma, and feel guilty that I am bothered by my nightmares.     -- August, 2005

Allentown, Pennsylvania-
I remember where I was on Sept. 11, 2001 when the first plane hit the World Trade Center: I was in court in Vincennes, Indiana. When the judge came in and expressed his condolences for the families of the people there, and in Washington D.C., a murmur ran through the crowd: what was he talking about? my mom and I looked at each other and we felt sort of clueless, but when we got to the car, it was all over the news.

Everything had stopped: every regular broadcast was pre-empted to cover what became the second of two of the darkest days in American history. we got home in time to see the second plane hit the WTC, and I can honestly say not many things make me cry but as I watched those towers collapse I cried. looking back I am not sure if it was my own pain or the collective pain of the nation I was proudly born into; I may never know but I do know that when the sorrow subsided, something else came forth: anger. a great deal of anger. who did this? where are they? lets kick their &amp;%*es, I said to myself.

hold on, now, theres more. thats when the reports of flight 93 and the first victory in the war on terror came: I whooped and hollered because I knew that someone had fought back. the fight was on and I had a gut feeling that the pitbull-like tenacity of the American people would prevail. but for months after, it seemed as though all we could do is hurt. that wound ran deep, very deep, and I'll explain how deep later. 

a year later, I was in Marysville, California, and I was given the unique opportunity to write an essay in a contest ( the Spirit of Freedom Awards) for my hometown paper, and I gave it everything I had: I pulled all the stops creatively to tell my story and convey a message of hope and strength. to my suprise, i took first place. t6hat doesn't matter, except that victory is for all those who didn't make it in 9/11/01, I won that for them and got the message out. at the award ceremony I spoke only briefly, though some say i am long winded I suprised everyone by simply saying I hoped that the message was worthy of those it was written about.

I think I did O.K.

I also wrote them ( the terrorists) a letter once, but I doubt I can post the whole contents on here because of the graphic nature of the letter and the extreme language I used. but I can tell you how it started and ended: it started &quot;dear stupid idiots without honor,&quot; and ended &quot;yours truly, the Angry American (one of millions)&quot;. (thank you Toby Keith for that rallying cry). I basically told them off in about 50 different ways, I think it was my way of coping with the deep anger and hurt. I never got to mail it, but some day, I just might. I'll address it to Osama bin Laden and stick a pinless hand grenade in with it. I'll take a fine tip pen and write the name of every person who died on 9/11 (NY,Washington D.C. and Pa.), 5/11 (Madrid) and 7/7 (London) on the grenade before I put it in there so that justice will be done. or, maybe I'll burn it. maybe I'll just hide it somewhere. I don't know I am still coping with that.

in 2004, I went to New York City, and I went to Ground Zero and thats when I realized how deep the wound in Americas' heart was. the silence, the.. the right words to describe it escape me. it was so sad I cried (again). but again, that anger surfaced: we knew who did this, and we were gonna bring them down. but as I passed by Ground Zero, all I could say was, &quot; oh god.. oh god.&quot;  

how could someone do this sort of thing? HOW? I don't know the answer and I doubt, gentle reader, you do either. as I left the site, I realized there is still much evil in the world, that day it took a physical form and killed 4000+ people at the WTC, the Pentagon, and in Western Pa. but there is much good, too, because I think of those who rushed into those burning buildings with no regard for their own life to save others, I think of those who took back that plane (flight 93) and struck down evil where it stood. 

this year, and every year since that horribly tragic morning, I mark a moment of silence and a prayer thanking God for those who would stand against the darkness. I pray for the families of all those lost and I ask he give them some comfort and hope. this year, though, I got 2 patches from the Navy Exchange and put it on my leather jacket: on the left arm, the Operation Noble Eagle patch; on the right the Culpepper Flag. for those unfamiliar with this flag, it is a red and white striped flag with a rattlesnake across it and black petters at the bottom: &quot; Don't Tread On Me.&quot; don't tread on me, I think thats a collective sentiment from this country. 

if you read this, I hope perhaps I have touched off something in you: not hate, not anger, but hope. hope that good will win the day and already has won the day, that we can't just wave our flags for a year or two and then be content to go back to the way we were.when iron becomes steel it can't go back to being iron, we must not forget how that day changed us for better or worse. that day still echoes within the fiber of my being: it made me stronger.

I especially want to thank those who are overseas fighting to make this world right again. our troops and the collective troops of any nation who fights against those who would kill innocents. I also want to extend my heartfelt condolences to our bretheren in Spain who felt their own loss on 5/11/04 and to our brothers in arms in England who felt evils' sting on 7/7/05.

they awoke the sleeping giants, and P.S., they're pissed. (thanks to Thumper of Thumpers' wavs for that righteous quote.)

Oakville, Ontario, Canada

I remember September 11, 2001 fondly, it happened during my first week of high school, I had no clue what went on during the entire day of school. I had been busily going about my business at school. My father came to pick me up from school and while driving home he mentioned to me that two planes smashed into the World Trade Center in New York. At first, I couldn't believe it, I immediately denied what I was hearing thinking it was a very terrible joke, but then he said this was no joke. As soon as I got home I turned on the TV and practically every channel covered the news and I could not believe what I was witnessing. Immediately many questions came to mind, I wondered if the planes might have lost contact and some how lost altitude and hit the towers. Then I realized that there were two more planes, one that slammed into The Pentagon and the other that crashed in Pennsylvania. I was so sad and angry at the bastards that slammed those planes into the city where I grew up. I waited for the President to address the Nation on television. Though I do not agree with President Bush at all now, at the time I needed leadership and I needed comfort and he delivered it, I feel happy to hear someone take the pulse of the Nation and put it into words.

For the next few days I reflected and could not believe what had happened. The world was about to change, at the time I did not want to fly. But soon, I did gather up the courage to do those things. I prayed for the families who had been affected by this tragedy, and for the brave police officers and fire fighters.

I hope by reading this you did get a sense of a foreigner's point of view from what I say. --[[User:207.188.66.33|207.188.66.33]] 02:42, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

Houston, TX
The day before the 9/11 attacks, I was up all night arguing with my boyfriend about whether Saddam Hussein could be a redeemable character or not. (He feels the attacks answered the question. http://www.chrisxradio.com) The next morning, I remember waking up from a nap at the school where I was teaching, to see the television images of planes crashing into smouldering flames, right before the buildings collapsed. I had just lost my father July 31, then Sept. 11 hit, then on October 1 the director of our school died, leaving me to run the administration from 6am-11pm for 3 months until the students finished their finals. I did not have time to finish grieving for these back-to-back losses. That fall, I wrote a memorial song as a tribute to the Firefighters and Families of 9/11 http://www.houstonprogressive.org/believe/believe.html. I was in the middle of producing this memorial song for public radio this fall, when Hurricane Katrina flooded Houston with evacuees from Louisiana and, weeks later, Hurricane Rita forced me, along with 2.8 million other residents, to flee from Houston and Galveston. I am still in Austin, feeling the suppressed panic of being stuck in a 100-mile long traffic jam, which I never want to see again. If I cannot even handle the stress of a planned evacuation, think of the families who survived 9/11.

Virginia Beach, Virginia 
Hello, I am known as Jeb or even as 'jebbie' by many in northern Virginia, in the Woodbridge area in Prince William County.

I was in Virginia Beach on September 11 2001.
I was conducting a jebwalk along the concrete boardwalk in Virginia Beach on that morning, at about 830am. I was nearing 33rd Street at about 9am when I heard someone say something about an airliner crashing into a building in New York City. I turned and said I thought that was a joke in very poor taste. He replied that it had actually happened. This guy showed me his room at the Thunderbird hotel on 33rd Street, where about 20 other people were watching the TV.

I saw another plane crash into one of the World Trade Center towers. I said, What a terrible accident. Someone in the room said it was a terrorist attack. We watched the towers burn and then people started jumping out of the buildings. I was dazedly thinking that this looked like a Hollywood-produced disaster movie, but the problem was that it was REAL, and ongoing. Then we watched the towers collapse.

At that point it abruptly became too much for me to watch anymore. I stumbled out of there completely devastated beyond words. I wandered around in a fog all day. Later on I found a lonely space between two beach cottages in North Virginia Beach and fell down on my knees and cried my eyes out. I had no idea what else to do. This was way beyond my experience and I could not even begin to cope with it.

Later on I stumbled back to my hotel, still in a daze and numb. I knew our whole world had changed. The people I was staying with were saying over and over, We need to go kick some ***, over and over again. They were completely ticked off. Some of them never stopped watching that TV until we left four days later.

The next day I noticed something unbelievable: Strangers helping each other on the street. I went out to get a newspaper and found a pile of quarters on the newsstand. I could not bear to use them. I went and got five dollars' worth of quarters, bought one newspaper then left the remaining quarters on the newsstand for others to use. It was amazing and intriguing the way Americans reacted to this disaster: Helping each other out like I have never seen before in my entire life. 

When I got home on September 14, I saw people holding candlelight vigils on street corners all over my neighborhood. I had never seen that before in my neighborhood. People were very, very nice, even people I had never met before in my life.

This was a very traumatic but also interesting time.

''Pasadena, California''

At first I had no idea how much this impacted my family.  Local time in California is three hours behind New York.  I was checking an e-mail list and saw a very short post.  It said something like, &quot;Turn on the news right now.  I'm not kidding.&quot;  So I turned on the radio.  In the immediate aftermath of the attacks the station management hadn't thought to suspend the commercials.  So it was very strange, hearing about the destruction and breaking every few minutes to get advertisements for toothpaste and the like.

My uncle was an engineer who did contracting work for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.  I guessed all the telephone lines would be busy back east so I called a cousin in northern California.  He had just heard from New York.

In the next two minutes I learned that yes, Uncle Bill worked in Manhattan.  Yes, his office was in the World Trade Center: seventy-second floor, north tower.  And yes, he had gotten out alive.

My cousin and I made a telephone tree and called the rest of the family.  Over the following days and months I learned more about my uncle's remarkable escape.  It never seemed right to pry.  I just listened.  He had been having a morning meeting with his boss when the first airplane struck.  He was a few floors below the impact, close enough that the shock knocked a lot of large objects.  That debris killed his boss instantly.  My uncle wasn't touched.

My uncle didn't even stop by his desk to pick up his wallet.  He went straight for the stairwell, which was what everyone else was doing.  So the descent was very slow.  When he finally got close to the lower floors the firefighters started coming upward, making the descent even slower.  It took my uncle more than an hour to get out.

When he reached the street level the floor was nearly knee deep in water, probably from firefighting efforts or a water main break.  The ground floor of the World Trade Center was about the size and layout of a suburban shopping mall.  My uncle says it took him ten minutes to wade to the exit.

If you know the timetable for how the north tower collapsed you know that cuts things very close.  My uncle escaped less than one minute before it fell.  He only had enough time to run across the street before it came crashing down.  He ducked into a subway entrance to avoid the debris.  My cousins say he saw body parts falling out of the sky.

Most of the people from my uncle's office are no longer alive.

In the chaos immediately following the disaster the streets hadn't been closed yet.  So he went to his apartment, took a shower, and changed his clothes.  It would be three weeks before he would be able to sleep in his own bed again.

I joined the Navy because of that day.

I was olny in Year Two at the time of September 11. You gotta remember thogh, that Year twos are not the smartest people. But, on the day, I woke up early, because I had to go to before school care. But, I went out into the TV room of my house and saw that image that I will never forget. I saw the plane crashing into the tower. Dad drove me to school and we went to the Before school care. The thing I remember most was, that everyone was crouded around the TV, and someone walked into the room. The person, who obvisly did not hear about 9.11 before this moment walked into the room, his eyes wide in horror.

I was on my way to an interview at Morgan Stanley. I had stopped off at my school to burn my portfolio onto a CD for the art department. I was goofing off with some friends at the PC labs so I lost bit of time. Eventually I flew out of the lab and ran to the train.  After 30 minutesv the subway ride over was suddenly stopped. The conductor announced what happened. A chill went down my spine and I almost broke down. If I hadn't goofed off at school, god knows what wouldve happened if i went in on time

I received this email sep. 12, 2001

Re: Hope
It was nice to hear from you. One of my best friends was in one of those flights that crashed into the towers. He was on his way from Boston to LA on a business trip. You may have known him. He was [[Patrick Currivan]].

A great loss. It hits home much more when it is so close.
Peace be with you.

I was only 11 years old when they bombed the World Trade Center, and I distinctly remember sitting on our daycare's green rocking chair, next to the radio. It was really early in the morning, and I was very sleepy. So when CBC radio announced that a plane had been sent into the World Trade Center (North) in New York, I thought it was a joke. I told my mom, who was working at the daycare - about what I had heard. She ignored my comment, thinking I was just joking around, and continued to work. I was scared - I mean, really...what if it happened to us? 

The news finally set in with my mom. I had to make sure that none of the younger kids heard anything, because if they did, they'd flip out. I was in way too much shock, and at first, I didn't want to go to school - but, I knew I had to. 

When I got to school, the older kids and the kids in my year were talking about &quot;how cool it must have been to see an airplane go into a building at a 'bajillion' miles an hour.&quot; Next thing I knew, a boy started beating up another kid because of what he had said. I talked to the boy a few days later, and asked him why he did it. He said that he feared his distant cousin, who worked with FDNY - and was apparently working on that day (as he worked 6 days a week and that was NOT his day off) might have died rescuing someone. He also had an auntie working somewhere on the South Tower, but hadn't heard from her. I had talked to him on September 15th. The last time I saw him - two years ago - he said that his auntie had never called them since.

I know that September 11th was a devastating day in the lives of not just those living in New York, or the States - but a devastating day in the lives of all of us throughout the world. Although we have borders between us, we are all connected - and I know that I certainly felt the brunt of that attack. Not physically, but emotionally. 

September 11th has inspired in me a lot of things that I never thought I would do. In any event, I'm sixteen now, and I know that I will be going into government work. I never want to see what happened on that day happen again. And I curse the person who wrote that message above mine - and those who feel that these attacks were justifiable in any way. That is not what people with a heart would write. 

God Bless America, and may He bless you, and protect you from all that comes your way.

Place: Chicago, IL

On September 11, 2001, I was like any typical child whose birthday is a couple of days away. That morning I wake up and got ready for school as usually, ready to broadcast nine more days until my 12th birthday. Seating in class, all I remember is the princple coming over the innercom, saying that all students will leave school early. That was after the first plane hit. My teacher turned the tv on in our room and a split second later, we saw the second plane hit the second tower. We left the school early due to threats on the sears tower. When I got home, I cried, I never mentioned my birthday that day or couple of days after, all I could think about was the many people that were killed, and the many people all over the world that were hurt and forever will be hurt by this tragedy.

NW Indiana.

I had been divorced for several years, living in NW Indiana with my girlfriend; my ex and two kids lived a short drive away in Chicago. I was in the first semester of law school, and becoming progressively overwhelmed by the amount of reading. Because it was impossible to spend the day in class and commuting and still get the reading done, I decided to stay home that day, September 11. We had radio and internet but no television. Sometime after 9AM, my ex calls me and says that New York is under terrorist attack, maybe Chicago will be attacked, what should we do? Thinking that this was a pretty typical delusional anxiety attack from her, I decided to humor her. &quot;I'm sure that the terrorists wouldn't attack a Chicago suburb--the kids will be fine.&quot; I get off the phone slightly bemused, go look at the news on the Internet. Something is up. I turn on NPR. About 9:30 or so, my girlfriend comes in after having already left for school in Chicago: the trains have been shut down, no one is getting into Chicago today. I think: well, I picked the right day to play hooky. Then while the radio is playing--I'm not sure what time this was--I'm on the Internet and see the pictures. &quot;What's going on with the Towers?&quot; she asks me. Long pause. &quot;The Towers are ''gone''.&quot; I start ranting loudly about the Israelis and the Palestinians, and how enough is enough and some international force should just impose its will on the both of them, as their insanity seems to have spilled out into the rest of the world (I assume, for some reason, that Palestinians have done this). The rest of the day goes normally--we live in a semi-rural town, the sun is shining. I feel some sort of inexorable, inexplicable need to somehow connect with the events unfolding, and lacking any TV cable service, feel strangely shut off from the world. This prompts me, again, somewhat inexplicably, to race to the video store and rent ''The Siege'', which I watch that afternoon at home, to her dismay.

Back at school, sometime that week... The student body meets on the main floor lobby and there is some kind of moment of silence. Things are still sinking in. At lunch, one of the Jewish students comments &quot;of course it was Saddam...&quot; In class, a woman raises her hand and says that someone on her cellphone just said that the Sears Tower is being evacuated because a plane is coming for it from O'Hare. The professor, usually a smug study in aplomb, exclaims &quot;then let's get the hell out of here!&quot; (We are in the shadow of the Tower).  We all flee out to the street, mill around, smoke cigarettes and then wander back in after awhile.

Sometime later, I read a Seymour Hersh article about securing nukes in Pakistan in the event of turmoil. In the same class, I kibbitz with a friend and offer, astoundingly enough, to bet him a hundred dollars that nuclear weapons will be used against a civilian population sometime before we graduate. The bet is real and I really believe this. Two years and some months later, I write him a check; in the meantime he milked the story of my crazy bet for all it's worth...

Over the next couple of years, time goes by like nothing has happened. I know no one directly affected. Sometimes I close my eyes, and see horrifying images, as if I have PTSD, just like in a movie, a hard cut to some shocking footage of massive destruction, screams, bodies falling through space. Why is this? I didn't even see it on television. Strangers on the other side of the world have colonized my imagination.

I become obsessed with the coming Iraq War. I tell a friend sometime in late 2001 that war against Iraq is now inevitable. He says &quot;the Democrats will never allow it.&quot; I pretend to be a kind of amateur pundit, but in my heart I know: I want revenge. I want people to die. Unimaginable numbers of people. Later when I hear the &quot;Bush lied us into a war&quot; rhetoric, I think: self-deception is sweet--the surging swell of the American collective unconscious wanted Arabs dead, lots of Arabs dead, any Arabs. In the little steel town where I lived, we all had murder in our hearts. American flags everywhere. In the nick of time, I come out against the war before it starts; hundreds of times in hundreds of conversations, I mention &quot;I was against the war.&quot; Two blocks away, a neighbor loses a son in Iraq; now yellow ribbons everywhere.

David Bowie releases ''Heathen''. In the song 'Sunday,' he says &quot;Nothing has changed/Everything has changed.&quot; Whenever I think of 9/11 now, I hear those words.

Waalre, The Netherlands (Holland)

It's now 5 years ago the atacs on sept.11th took place. On the day itself I was working and we had a fire-drill at the school I worked at. I remember everybody leaving the building and outside smoked their cigarettes chit-chatting. 2 hours later sombody bursted into our office: &quot;Two planes crashed into the WTC in New York.&quot; There were no TV's for us to watch. So we searched the Internet. We where flabberghasted by what we saw. 1 hour later I went to pick up my daughter (6 months) and went home. The second I turned on the TV I saw the first tower collapse Live on TV.

I collapsed on the couch as well. I could not beleve my eyes. At some time you want to turn off the TV, but you just can't. My little daughter sat with me, unusualy quiet, as if she could feel something was realy off. Now 5 years later I'm still shocked by the documentaries and stories. The last few weeks I've been reading personal stories of survivors, families and friends and others about 9/11. Many times I had to stop, overwelmed by the stories.

It was a day that changed the way of thinking in our world. Even in the smallest corners of the world.

Al people are equal, so stop beïng stupid and accept people for what they are and not change them in to what you want them to be. I'm South-African born, live in Holland and know two cultures. If you can not adapt, then at least take it for what it is.

My thoughts are with all those struck by this terrible day.

Mountain View (SF Bay Area), CA

At the time, I had a long commute so used to get up at 5 am, do chores, drink some coffee, watch the early news to check traffic, then out the door at 6:50. On the West Coast, it was 5:50 am or so when the news first broke - just the shots of the fire in the first tower and still not sure if was a small plane that hit it. I woke up my husband and told him &quot;something bad is going on New York&quot;. We were watching live when the second plane hit. To this day, I will remember that my brain simply couldn't process what I was seeing - &quot;Why are planes flying into the buildings?&quot;. My husband new immediately - &quot;it's deliberate&quot;. That's when I got scared - really, really, really scared. During the first few hours, we really didn't know the extent. My husband and I decided I would not get on the road. We felt the possibility that San Francisco might be in danger and he didn't want me too far from home. At that point I called my parents - &quot;Are you watching TV?&quot; I asked. No, they were in bed. I told them to turn on the TV. And then we just watched, horrified. At some point, we began to hear of/see the jumpers. It still haunts me to this day. I can't even write about it now - the tears start to flow immediately - it is just too much to bear.  

At some point my sister called me - she was pretty panicked. I went into the den and tried to talk her down and tell her not to go into work - just stay home - and my husband called me from the living room to tell me one of the towers had collapsed. Again, my brain was simply not processing the information - I was numb. I honestly couldn't accept what was there in front of me. Then the second tower fell and that's when I lost it. I really lost it. All those lives - gone in an instant. It just became real at that point. I screamed and cursed and cried.

Today, I still get chills when I see the film footage. It will never leave me - not ever. The initial shock and fear not knowing how many planes, how many cities. The raw despair as the day wore on and the reality of all sunk in. The compassion as the stories came out. How could you make a last call from that plane? What would I do if it were me facing a horrible death - would I jump? What would I do if my husband were among the missing? The footage of the folks lining the streets as the volunteers from all over poured in. You went from the depths of despair to the heights of pride - from unimaginable anguish to such incredible stories of heroism - from death to life. Emotions were just whipsawed back and forth. And realizing that we were witnessing something so profound in our history - even more profound than the Kennedy, the moon walk - both of which I experienced and remembered. It was so much more.

And now, every year, at 5:45 am, I cross the street to our local fire house and leave my small remembrance. The station has a wonderful bronze sculpture hanging on the station wal. A fireman's hat and coat, as if hanging on a peg hang on the wall, a pair of boots just below - and two dalmation pups playing in the boots. Put up before 9/11, I believe it was meant to be whimsical. For me, it is the gear of a lost hero. So each 9/11,  I place a single candle there. In gratitude for all they do and in memory for the lost of that day. It seems so small considering the enormity of that loss. But it's my small way to keep the memory of those souls alive.

Claremont, CA

I was in my sophomore year of college at the time.  I got ready in the morning just like any other day, not checking the internet news because of an early class.  I went to the suite next door, waiting on my neighbors to go to breakfast together like usual.  Within a few mintues one of them got an email from a parent in Texas telling him to turn on CNN.  When we flipped on the TV, there were the smoking towers, looming large on the screen.  The reporters obviously didn't know what was going on.  The morning toothbrushing continued while we waited for the newscaster to offer more information.  I think we must have woken up some of the other suitemates at some point, because it seems all five of us were watching by the time the first tower collapsed.  It all seemed so unreal, how slow it all unfolded on television.  I remember the newscaster talking frantically the whole time, but I don't remember what he said.  He really had nothing to add beyond what we were all seeing and feeling.  We all thought that a bomb had caused the collapse, and watched the replays closely, speculating in the absence of facts.  We went to our class in a little bit of a daze; we didn't have enough time for breakfast anymore.

When we got to the lecture hall, the professor was standing in front of the room next to a radio tuned to the news.  He let us sit and listen until a few minutes before we normally started, then announced that class was cancelled, telling the students from New York that they should go call their parents.  He was the only professor I knew of that day who cancelled a class, but it was one of the few early lectures.  Some friends from New England said that they'd already tried their parents, but couldn't get through.   I think it must have been personal for them than us, who were all from the South or Southwest, wondering if any family had been down to New York on business, counting how many friends had moved to the City.  We went back to the suite to watch more CNN, but I don't remember much of the rest of the newscast.  I think we were a little too numb by the time the second tower collapsed for it to make much of an impact.

I can't believe that this child has so little written about him.  Eric, you didn't deserve what happened to you.  As for why you were there... it doesn't really matter now.  What does matter is that the world has been a darker place since the events of 9/11.  I hope that you are in a much better place.  Sweet Angel, Rest in Peace.

I went to grammar school with John at St.Adalbert's in Staten Island, NY.  I may not have known him very well back then but as an adult I realize that we all know each in the spiritual sense.  It saddened me to hear he had passed away.  I have a brother-in-law, a future brother-in-law and two cousins who are all firefighters in NYC and who were all off that day.  I thank God for that but I also grieve for the McAvoy family who lost a son and possibly a brother and a husband and a father.  My thoughts and prayers have been with all of you this past year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Myra Joy Aronson''' was a warm, funny, talented person who turned up at the office one [[en:Halloween|Halloween]] dressed in full professional hockey gear, stick included. 

She was a wonderful writer, and a lousy liar. Somehow she managed to combine both into a career in public relations that set a standard for clarity, brevity and honesty that the majority of her peers will never know. 

Those of us who worked with her recognized her talents then, and mourn her loss now. 

Died on September 11 2001 in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 11]]

Falkenberg died aged eight in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 77]]. She was traveling to [[en:Australia|Australia]] with her father, [[Charles Falkenberg]], mother, [[Leslie Whittington|Leslie A. Whittington]], and sister, [[Dana Falkenberg]] for her mother's sabbatical from work.

==Tributes==
My childhood babysitter died recently, 12/13/05, of cancer.  Before she died, she told us not to be sad, that she was going to Heaven to take care of the innocents that have passed on.  Since she spent so much time helping survivors of 9/11, I knew she meant the child victims of that horrible event, .  She always said that it was &quot;terrible that those darling babies spent their last moments in fear&quot;.  Well, Nancy, you can now help them and ease their fears.  Give them all a kiss for us.  God Bless you.  Zoe, let my Nanny Nancy take care of you.  She is good at it. --Abigaile Beaudelaire

=== Zoe, I Hardly Knew Ye ===
I never knew you very well, Zoe, but I do remember you. You were in my Girl Scout Troop 96 seven years ago. I remember you as a cute little first-grader with blonde hair, I think. I wish I had gotten to know you better. Rest In Peace. Laura.

==Tributes==
My childhood babysitter died recently, 12/13/05, of cancer.  Before she died, she told us not to be sad, that she was going to Heaven to take care of the innocents that have passed on.  Since she spent so much time helping survivors of 9/11, I knew she meant the child victims of that horrible event, .  She always said that it was &quot;terrible that those darling babies spent their last moments in fear&quot;.  Well, Nancy, you can now help them and ease their fears.  Give them all a kiss for us.  God Bless you.  Dana, let my Nanny Nancy take care of you.  She is good at it. --Abigaile Beaudelaire

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wanda Anita Green''' was a flight attendant. She grew up in Oakland, California and later moved to Linden, New Jersey to live near the United Airlines hub. Wanda worked for 30 years as a flight attendant with United.

As a young woman, Wanda Green sought her mother's blessing to become a flight attendant. Though Aserene Smith was hesitant, she finally relented, and Wanda Green became one of the first African-Americans to join United Airlines as a flight attendant, according to her mother.

Whether she was listening to neighbors at their front gates in Linden, befriending the families she helped to find homes as a real estate agent, or comforting children during rough landings as a part-time United Airlines flight attendant, Wanda Anita Green delighted in helping others. 

Green, 49, was an earnest listener who never judged, said her longtime friend and fellow flight attendant Sugar Manley. 

&quot;She would stay up all night with you, she just cared for your soul, your spirit&quot;, said Manley. 

As a deacon at Linden Presbyterian Church, Mrs. Green visited people in local hospitals, and volunteered her time for church activities, said her daughter, Jennifer Green. 

Mrs. Green adored dancing the cha-cha and the slide, said Manley, but she would not buy herself new dancing shoes unless her children each had two pair. 

&quot;Oh, she would sacrifice it all for her children&quot;, said Manley. &quot;Her shoes might have had a slight hole in them, but she wouldn't do for herself. Her kids came first&quot;. 

Mrs. Green, who worked as a United Airlines flight attendant for 29 years and was getting ready to retire, was aboard the hijacked United Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco when it crashed in rural Pennsylvania on Tuesday. Mrs. Green had planned to visit her mother in Oakland, Calif. 

&quot;Wherever she went, she made a friend, she really cared about people&quot;, said Jennifer Green. 

Mrs. Green grew up in Oakland and married and lived for several years in Rockland County, N.Y., before settling in Linden. After she earned a real estate license in 1996, Mrs. Green flew less frequently, and she worked as an office manager and agent at NorthStar Realty in South Orange.

She is survived by her mother, brother, twin sister and two children. 

The New Jersey State Senate passed a resolution as a testament to her contributions as a citizen and in recognition of her courage on FC Flight 93.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Berry Berenson''' ('''Berinthia B. Perkins''') (1948 - September 11, 2001) was a model, actress and photographer. She died at age 53 in the [[en:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on board [[American Airlines Flight 11]]. She had been returning from a holiday in Cape Cod to her California home.

She was survived by her two sons, Osgood Perkins, Jr. and Elvis Perkins.

----

Berry Berenson had an aura that was unique. She was blessed with grace and beauty as well as a wide ranging intelligence. From her photographs one could see that she saw not with her eyes but through her eyes and that the world entered through these eyes that led to her heart and to her immense soul. Her death at a young age was more than tragic. It was an attack on Life itself, the theft of such a promising and uncompleted career. I had the great pleasure of meeting her older sister once in the 70's in London while she was filming and was struck by her beauty and the feline elegance with which she moved---like Rilke's immortal Panther--at once near and remote. She was wearing a dress which gave me some indication of what I judged to be the most beautiful thighs God ever created. I can imagine the loss she feels at her sister's untimely death and can only offer my deeply felt sympathy for her pain as partial assuagement. &quot;Oswald LeWinter&quot; American Poet living in Portugal

Mike Asher gave me my first chance in the USA. I finished school at Villanova, a fresh graduate out of school from India and Mike hired me on a strange connection he felt between my skills and the company. He is one of the best persons to shake a hand with; firm and genuine. He shook my hand and gave me my first job in the USA. I owe him that forever. I still remember his eyes as they glistened in excitement of the growing company. I have many occasions that I remember not liking him as part of my job, but the only lingering impression I have of him is his excitement toward opportunities. His eyes just light up. I like him because he is a genuine, fair and honest human being. What else does a person need to do to get to heaven?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stephen Vernon Long''' was a major who died in the [[Pentagon]] attack, aged 39.

----

Steve was a student of mine in a public personnel management class being taught at Ft Belvoir for Troy State University. We would often chat after class. At the class session before September 11 I had distributed results of the midterm examination. They were dismal. After class Steve expressed his apologies for not having worked harder to meet his own expectations. He was a man of great energy, and undaunting Christian faith. He was an avid athelete, and loved the tests of stamina activities (mountain climbing, parachuting). He had recently undergone knee surgury, and doubtless this operation put him at a disadvantage on 911. One never knows. I had heard that he was not immediately killed, but was seen going back into the chaos to help others escape. True or not, this sounds just like him. 

Steve was a classmate (and ROTC alum)of mine at Augusta College in Augusta, GA. He was a prior service enlisted Ranger, a veteran of the Grenada invasion. He was an outstanding man who put Christ and his family first. He loved his step-sons and his wife. He was a gifted athlete and a genuinely outstanding person. A great sense of humor and bedrock midwestern values characterized his personality. Although I hadn't seen him in 14 years, I still feel his loss. The US lost a patriot and a son. I lost an example of what it means to be a good man and an outstanding soldier.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stephen Emanual Poulos''' was an [[en:opera|opera]] singer and IT officer. He lived in [[en:Basking Ridge, New Jersey|Basking Ridge, New Jersey]], and worked for [[Aon Corporation]]. 

Poulos was killed at work on the 103rd floor of the World Trade Center during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 

Stephen loved opera, having spent decades singing baritone. Being forced to abandon his dream of being an opera singer embittered him towards opera, until he began to engage in the ''New York Times'' online opera forum as the contentious &quot;billybobives&quot;. 

Poulos was survived by his wife, Lisa Poulos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sonia Morales Puopolo''' was a former ballet dancer and a nationwide philanthropist. She was born and raised in Puerto Rico and moved to Boston as a young woman in her late teens when she met her husband Dominic J. Puopolo, Sr. at a Catholic School dance. She was most importantly a wonderful mother of three adult children; Dominic Jr., Mark Anthony, and Sonia &quot;Tita&quot; Puopolo and a loyal wife and business partner to her husband Dominic J. Puopolo, Sr for 38 years. 

Mrs. Puopolo's tireless work for charities, such as the Miami City Ballet, and other charitable causes such as Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Breast Cancer Center, demostrated her love and respect for her life and the life of others. &quot;Mrs. Puopolo was a giver in life and not a taker&quot; as was quoted by her son Dominic J. Puopolo, Jr. after the conviction of one of the terrorists who killed his mother.

Mrs. Puopolo died at age 58 while seated in the first class cabin onboard [[American Airlines Flight 11]] during the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks. She witnessed and was subjugated to extreme violence the hijackers comitted in order to hijack American Airlines 11.

She alternated every six months living in Boston, Massachusetts and Miami, Florida.

Since then her adult children have followed in their mother's legacy. They have turned the horror of 9/11 and their mother's death as a call to action to achieve through education and through the pursuit of justice to possibly provide a way for others to avoid suffering their personal loss at the hands of terrorists. 

Sonia &quot;Tita&quot; Puopolo and Dominic J. Puopolo, Jr. have both each, in their own way, contributed to seeing their mother's legacy fulfilled and memory honored.

Her oldest son Dominic J. Puopolo, Jr. since September 11, 2001 has pursued justice for his mother's death in various forms. Most significantly Dominic Jr. moved to Hamburg, Germany in August 2004 to assist, as allowed under German law, in the terrorist retrial of Mounir El-Motassadeq for one year. 

Dominic Jr. successfully worked alongside German federal prosecutors along with his German legal team of Christian Weise, RA and Andreas Schulz, RA to successfully argue, before a tribunal of five German federal justices to convict Motassadeq in the year long retrial.

Motassadeq, a co-conspirator in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, admitted jihadist, and close friend of the 9/11 suicide pilot Atta (who killed Sonia Puopolo along with her fellow passengers on American Airlines Flight 11) wired monies from Germany to Florida. These monies in large part were to pay for flight school training for three of the four 9/11 suicide hijacker pilots.

Dominic Jr. previously went to Hamburg, Germany to testify during the 9/11 terrorist trial of Abdelghani Mzoudi on December 4, 2003. Mzoudi was acquitted by the German Supreme Court in July 2005, but immediately expelled from Germany back to his native Morocco.

Motassadeq was subsequently convicted of membership in a terrorist organization one month later on August 19, 2005 in Hamburg. He received an immediate sentence of 7 years to be served in a German federal prison from presiding Judge Ernst Schudt. Dominic Jr. most recently attended the final day of the 9/11 terrorist trial of United States v. Zacarias Moussaoui. 

This for the sentencing elgibility phase of the convicted terrorist's trial during Spring 2006. He was also present in the courtroom for Moussaoui's guilty plea hearing on April 22, 2005. This has brought Dominic Jr's involvement and participation to a total of three 9/11 terrorist criminal trials in order justice was afforded his mother Sonia and all those innocently lost on September 11, 2001.

Sonia Morales Puopolo's daughter Sonia &quot;Tita&quot; Puopolo recently visited Saudi Arabia on the Saudi American Exchange program to better understand the country that some of the hijackers hailed from and to bridge the gap between the peoples of Saudi Arabia and America in order to prevent a recurrence of the horrific events of 9/11 borne of hatred and intolerance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sandra Bradshaw''' was a flight attendant on [[United Airlines Flight 93]].

She was born and raised in Climax, North Carolina and graduated from Eastern Randolph High School in Ramseur, North Carolina.  Following her younger sister, Sandra trained to become a flight attendant. She lived in Greensboro with her husband, a U.S. Airways pilot and her children while working part-time for United Airlines.

Bradshaw died at age 38 in the crash of [[w:United Airlines flight 93|United Airlines flight 93]] in the [[w: September 11, 2001 terrorist attack|September 11, 2001 terrorist attack]].  She was able to contact her husband during the hijacking and reported that the crew and passengers were planning to fight the hijackers. Her last words were &quot;We're all running to first class, I've got to go. Bye&quot;.  

Such instinctive actions by flight attendants were a notable feature of the attacks that day.  The role of attendants in flight security has been recognized and expanded as a result.  

She was survived by her husband, Phil; daughter, Alexandria, 2; son, Nathan, 1; step-daughter, Shenan 16; and other family. 

==Tributes==
Sandy - Not a day goes by that I don't think of you and say a prayer for your eternal rest and the comfort of your family.  I so treasure the fun trips we flew together when I was based in EWR and how you kept me enthusiastic and blessidly in shape!  You were always the first one to head to the workout room. 

What an inspiration.

I miss you my friend. Crystal Brown

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ruth Clifford McCourt was a resident of New London, Connecticut. 

She was born '''Ruth Magdaline Clifford''' in Cork, Ireland. Died at age 45 in the crash of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] during the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks with her four year old daughter, [[Juliana McCourt]], and a friend who had joined them for their intended vacation in Los Angeles. Juliana was her only child. 

She was survived by her husband, and her brothers John Clifford, Mark Clifford and Ronnie Clifford. Ronnie was working in the World Trade Center but escaped just as his sister's plane struck. 

A memorial to Ruth and her daughter Juliana was dedicated on September 11, 2003 at Mitchell College in New London, CT. Juliana was enrolled as a preschool student in the Children's Learning Center at Mitchell College. Also, a fund was created in their memories, The Juliana Valentine McCourt Children's Education Fund.

----

John Clifford: 

Tragically my sister hit the tower building as my brother was on the ground floor. He's safe now. He's very traumatised. He said he saw sights he would never see again. Very sad. Very evil, but he's safe. I was very concerned when the two buildings collapsed, because I knew Ronnie worked in one. He phoned to say he made it, he was okay, traumatised, that he was within an inch of his life. He went through the front door on the ground floor and a lady was about three seconds in front of him. She was hit by a terrific fireball. She subsequently died. 

He said that unfortunately, while he was OK, he had a feeling that his sister - my sister - had left Logan Airport to go to Los Angeles with her daughter at around 7.30 in the morning. So we were then concerned that she may have been on either of the two flights that crashed into the towers, and that was confirmed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ruben Ornedo''' was an American computer engineer. He died at age 39 in the crash of American Airlines flight 77 during the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks. A resident of Eagle Rock, California, he was a satellite communications engineer for Boeing. He immigrated from the Philippines with his family when he was in grade school. He graduated from Fairfax High in Los Angeles and from UCLA in computer engineering. He enjoyed traveling, hiking, mountain climbing, and renovating his new house. 

He was survived by his pregnant wife of three months, Sheila, and his brother, Dr. Eduardo Ornedo. He was on an extended business trip to Washington, and originally scheduled to leave a week later. He was taking an opportunity to go home briefly just to see his wife. 

==Tributes==
My many condolences go out to Mr. Ornedo's family. Being a Filipino myself, I just wanted to take this opportunity to say that may God bless you, and I'm praying for your family.  --Maraming Salamat, Esther B. Ohio, USA 

I knew Ruben. We knew each other from 1987 thru 1997 at the Westside YMCA in Los Angeles. He always had a smile. He was a good soul and I'm sorry he's gone. My love and prayers go out to his wife and new baby. I hope that his memory is never forgotten. I know that I will always hold a special thought for a sweet guy. Sincerely, Todd Pearl Now living in Michigan.

Hey Dan! It figures you're up there and looking down at all of us. I just wish you could have spoken to you and heard your voice one more time. I have so many questions that aren't answered. I can tell by talking to your family and friends that you were happy. I am very happy for you. I always knew you would be a great dad. Happy Father's Dad up in Heaven. Love you, Susan

I'm glad that you had someone to love for 14 years. I am also glad that your final moments were spent with the ones that you loved. Remember, Earth has no sorrows that Heaven can't heal.

I worked with Dan at PwC in 1999.  He was a fine and hardworking Partner, full of energy, drive and focus.  Very helful and considerate.  May God bless him and his loved ones, with eternal love and peace.  You are in my prayers.

Words cannot even say how i feel,about this innocent baby, losing is life to this ignorance......god bless you little david... --tami, michigan

How my heart breaks for such a darling baby to die in such a way i will never understand all this waste of such wonderful lives. --carol, Australia


My childhood babysitter died recently, 12/13/05, of cancer.  Before she died, she told us not to be sad, that she was going to Heaven to take care of the innocents that have passed on.  Since she spent so much time helping survivors of 9/11, I knew she meant the child victims of that horrible event, .  She always said that it was &quot;terrible that those darling babies spent their last moments in fear&quot;.  Well, Nancy, you can now help them and ease their fears.  Give them all a kiss for us.  God Bless you.  David, let my Nanny Nancy take care of you.  She is good at it.

'''American Airlines flight 11''' was an American Airlines Boeing 767 flight that left Boston's Logan International Airport to go to Los Angeles International Airport at a scheduled 7:59am every morning. It crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

==September 9, 2001==

Mohammed Atta is seen at Logan International Airport taking notes on the behavior of the flight crew on board American Airlines Flight 11.

==The hijacking==

Flight 11 takes off at 7:59am and is several minutes late. The last communication with Flight 11 was around 8:13am when it reached it's crusing altitude. At about 8:14am, Waleed al-Shehri, and Wail al-Shehri, sitting in seats 2A and 2B walked uup to two flight attendants and stabbed them. Daniel Lewin who was sitting in back of Satam al-Suqami tried to interfere, but was killed by most likely Suqami. After Wail and Waleed had stormed the cockpit, Mohammed Atta the trained pilot took over the plane. The hijackers moved the remaining passengers to the back of the plane. [[Betty Ong]], a flight attendant called American flight controllers on the ground. Midway through the hijacking Mohammed Atta turned on the transponder and said &quot;We have some planes, and a bomb on board. We are going back to the airport. If you try to make any stupid moves you will just endanger yourself and the plane&quot;

At 8:46:40, the plane crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alfred G. &quot;Al&quot; Marchand''' was a police officer and flight attendant. He had been a police officer in Alamogordo, New Mexico for over 20 years. He retired from that career and started a new one with United Airlines, where he planned to eventually become a pilot. 

Friends said he loved travel, flying and meeting people. Fellow church members remembered him as a devout Christian who would pick up children on Wednesdays, when he was not working, and drive them to church. They recalled a man who would drive donations to an orphanage in Ciudad Juárez every three months. A neighbor, Jason Hayes, said that Alfred Marchand once worked Hayes' shift at a local restaurant when Hayes' wife went into labor with their daughter.

Pastor Brian Hurst said Marchand once told a man who had been arrested that the man needed to bring Jesus Christ into his life.  &quot;He was a man of faith — he took it to work,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;He was the most down-to-earth, nonjudgmental person I've ever known. He'd talk to you like a human being.&quot;

Marchand died at age 44 during the [[en:September 11, 2001|September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks while on board [[United Airlines Flight 175]], where he was serving as a flight attendant. 

----

He was our son-in-law, the closest thing we will ever have to a son, and we loved him, appreciated him, and we miss him terribly. Every day is hard, especially for our daughter, Rebecca, his widow. Our lives are forever changed, in many different ways. But all we can do is keep going, and keep telling everyone what a wonderful, nice, caring, giving person he was. His mother, Irene, died December 12, 2001. Her priest said she died of a broken heart. I believe it. He was her only living child, and she really never stopped crying after September 11. Now they are together. And I am glad for her.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Robert John Fangman''' was a flight attendant. He enjoyed red wine, dancing, gourmet meals, pinball, as well as dyeing his close-cropped hair. Before taking a job with United Airlines in January, Mr. Fangman had worked for Verizon Wireless. &quot;He found his calling when he joined the airline&quot;, according to his mother. 

Ruth Fangman spoke to her son Robert for the final time on Saturday. 
Robert, a United Airlines flight attendant, had telephoned his mother at her Claymont home from Texas, where he was visiting his oldest brother, Marty, and other relatives. 

&quot;Bobby said he might come home to visit on Sunday,&quot; Ruth Fangman said Thursday from her tidy brick row house off Philadelphia Pike. &quot;But he stayed in Texas an extra day and never made it. Now I'll never see him again.&quot; 

So instead of anticipating the next visit from her son, Ruth Fangman has spent the last two days learning of his death, exchanging teary embraces with her other six children, accepting condolences from friends, and making plans for a memorial celebration in Bobby's honor. 

&quot;He was my baby,&quot; Fangman said, fighting back the tears. &quot;It hasn't really even sunk in yet.&quot; 

Ruth Fangman, a widow who had four sons and three daughters, spent an hour early Thursday at her kitchen table reminiscing about her youngest child with daughter Terri, who rushed up from her Virginia home after hearing Bobby was on the doomed flight. 

They spoke of his love of wine, gourmet food, big cities and international travel. They said he brightened many family gatherings with tales of his European journeys or by bursting into song, a cappella. 

&quot;He had a such a beautiful voice,&quot; said Terri, 43, who was in Texas last weekend with her brothers. 

The women said Bobby, a Claymont High School graduate who had sold cellular telephones for about four years, had found his calling as a flight attendant. 

He had met some attendants on a flight to Paris last year, became enamored with the lifestyle and decided to apply for a job with United. He was assigned to Boston in January. 

Bobby's happiest days were the last eight months, as he hop-scotched around the country and the globe, often taking last-second assignments to Europe, they said. 

&quot;But now he's gone,&quot; Ruth said. &quot;Words can't express how I feel. There's just a big hole in my heart.&quot;

He died at age 33 during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks while on board [[United Airlines Flight 175]]. 

He was survived by his sister Debbie, and his mother Ruth.

==Tributes==
This page honoring Robert Fangman is a wonderful tribute to his memory. I worked with Rob while he was with Verizon Wireless. At the company holiday party prior to his leaving the company for his flight attendant school he was wildly honored. He was so full of life, a truly great human. Knowing how excited he was to become a flight attendant he surly died doing what he loved most. God bless Rob Fangman. Bill Jones

Last year, Kevin M. Williams decided to pop the big question and ask Jillian Volk, his high school sweetheart, to marry him. Mr. Williams, 24, a bond salesman at Sandler O'Neill on the 104th floor of the south tower, took her to Macy's just before Christmas. Together on Santa's lap, he asked. &quot;She had tears of joy,&quot; said Dan Williams, his uncle. &quot;Kevin always had a knack to do something a little extra, to make those special occasions something a little extra.&quot; Since that day at Macy's, the wedding, scheduled for December, was all Mr. Williams talked about, even at a party in June for his brother's high school graduation. &quot;These were young people in love,&quot; his uncle said.

I remember when Aunt Celeste visited us in the Virgin Islands (she visited every year around the same time)...It was less than a month before 9-11.  I had given birth to my first child on 8-19 and Auntie was able to see and spend time with her. My Aunt was hard working vibrant, friendly, she loved the beach with a passion, and enjoyed the company of family and friends.  Before she left for New York, she discussed her plans to permanently reside in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands upon her return.  She loved to eat coconuts and local fresh fish

In our culture it is said, when a child is born a member of the family will pass to the next life...It is the way the earth cleans itself...As I was born in the memory of my Father Haile Selassie 1st and my ancentors, so is my daughter born in the memory of Haile Selassie 1st and her ancestors (Aunt Celeste).  Each generation should stand taller because they stand on the shoulders of their ancentors.  I am glad that we shared good times and am thankful to have benn part of her life.  Aunt Celeste was cool and down to earth, we really enjoyed her company.  My sister Daminah, told me of a conversation she held with Auntie concerning life.  They both agreed that life was just for a time, and no one knows what is going to happen, so you just have to love the life you live and live the life you love.  Wow, that discussion came up because Aliyah the singer had dided in a plane crash that very day.  Our family and her friends will greatly miss her!  Your heart lives on within us.  Through her passing my daughter came to being

Daddy (Dale Rogers) Aunt Celeste's brother, Jasmine her daughter, Aunt Denise-her sister and the rest of the home circle; Every thing is going to be alright!

John Joseph Murray: 'An irreplaceable human being'

As a child with red hair and an angelic face, John would win the hearts of all who met him. 

He was an honor student at Salesianum and had outstanding character. He was an excellent athlete, playing baseball, basketball, lacrosse, hockey and golf. He was also a strong swimmer, serving as a Long Island lifeguard, often leading dangerous ocean rescues. 

Following graduation from Boston College in 1990, John began a career as a New York City broker where he enjoyed considerable success. Still he found time for others. 

In 1997, he launched &quot;Putt for Progress,&quot; a foundation devoted to raising money for scleroderma research. 

Through a friend, he was introduced to Rory Owens &quot;as two people who should be together.&quot; Rory agreed. After their courtship, she accepted John's proposal, which came on one knee as they paused while jogging across the Brooklyn Bridge. 

After their marriage, their employers gave them the opportunity to relocate to London. This enabled them to travel in Europe before returning for the birth of their daughter, Alyson Rose, in April 2001. John loved his life as a father. 

His kindness, selflessness and honesty drew many people to him and he did his best to make time for everyone. 

John was a wonderful son, a loving and devoted husband, father, brother and friend. We miss him greatly, but will carry on in his name and in his memory. 

On Sept. 11, we lost a dearly loved family member. The world lost an irreplaceable human being. 

- Philip and Mary Louise Murray, of Brandywine Hundred, father and mother.

==Tributes==
&quot;I was a student on an 'educational field trip' with Ann (Project Marco Polo) in 1994. I remember her love for big earrings and good food. I also remember her huge presence, despite her shorter stature. She was a no-nonsense kind of a gal, but she always made us feel safe and loved. I also remember her incredible sense of humour. I will never forget that trip or the horrible events on 9/11/01.&quot; ~Meghan Spyker, 23, Music Therapist in San Francisco, CA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Uncle&quot; '''Andy Desperito''' was the father of three great children. Nicole, Anthony, and David. He left behind a loving wife Laura, sister Diane and both his parents Adele and Tony. He loved his sister's children including myself, Nick and my brother Joe, and he also had a wonderful relationship with our father Pat. Uncle Andy was a great man, who had a love for his children that cannot be described. He strove to be the best at everything he did, always going the extra mile to make the most of his life. On [[September 11, 2001]] he went the extra mile to help others live their lives to the max. He loved the [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]], and on that day he proved it. I will Never forget him or his &quot;not for nothing&quot; saying. Most of all I will miss him. I know he is watching us all and he knows that I love him, and he truly has made us all very proud. He is &quot;Our Hero&quot;, and I will never forget him. RIP Uncle Andy!                 

:-Nick

I had the privilege of getting to know Uncle Andy when I started dating his nephew Nick. He was always someone that could easily be admired. He took great pride in many things, but most of all in his family and in his job. It was inspiring to meet someone who loved what they did and always put forth 100 % effort each day that he went to work. He will be missed, but never forgotten. Anyone that ever met Uncle Andy is saddened by his death, yet they are not surprised that he risked his own life to save many others. The FDNY lost a wonderful man on September 11th, but his dedication and zest for life will always remain in our hearts.

:-Christine 

Just want to let you know that Bono of U2 was wearing the Engine 1 shirt at his concert. Also, as they sang &quot;One&quot; they listed all the names of the victims. Uncle Andy was there, although he would probably call U2's music noise.

:-Nick

Andy, you may be gone but you will never be forgotten!

:-Fred Eiss

I have known Andy for as long as I can remember.  He was a wonderful, funny person.  The one thing that especially sticks out in my mind, though, is how he always teased me about playing volleyball.  I am pretty bad and we always joked about it, but he always made sure I got up and played no matter what -- he didn't let me just sit there and feel sorry for myself.  That's the kind of person Andy was, and he will be missed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p ALIGN=&quot;CENTER&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;These things I will keep in my heart...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the movie &lt;i&gt;Arthur&lt;/i&gt;, Dudley Moore says that the best thing to have is fun. Fun was a strong voice in Amy's life. Amy was a fun person, a funny person, and sometimes a shockingly funny person. People, music, travel, politics, the diversity of New York City - these were some of the other strong voices in Amy's life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I met with Nadia a few days ago to discuss this service, she spoke to me about the many voices present in the Jewish religion. Here, I'll try to find expression for some of the many voices present in Amy. Many of her voices will not be heard today, but will be heard tomorrow, or next week, or next year. I've been trying to hear those voices by reliving the many wonderful memories we had together, by listening to her music, by watching her favorite movies, by reading her favorite books, and by spending time with her friends and family, who formed the fabric of her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used to all talk sometimes about &amp;quot;desert island&amp;quot; movies.  What movies would you want with you if you were stranded alone on a desert island?  I think Amy's true answer to that question would have been something like, &amp;quot;But what's the point, if there's no one there to share it with?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy and I first met in a chance encounter on the Long Island Rail Road.  About five minutes into the first conversation we ever had, she asked me if I liked to travel.  I said, &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; thinking to myself, &amp;quot;Of course!  Everyone likes to travel!&amp;quot;  It was only as I got to know Amy over the following two years that I realized she took a love of travel to a whole new level.  She wanted to see everything.  She wanted to experience everything.  And she wanted me to join her for the journey.  She wanted to see what sort of stuff you might buy in a local grocery store in Barcelona, just because it showed her a little more about how the people in the area lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, Amy and I traveled to London twice, to Scotland, to Spain, and to Costa Rica.  We were planning to travel to Japan in a few months.  We were planning to travel back to Latin America, and to take an intensive Spanish
language course so that we would never have to embarass ourselves again trying to explain to a Costa Rican cab driver where our hotel was by saying that it was the &amp;quot;grande building next to Denny's.&amp;quot;  We were planning
to travel to Australia after we married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy's desire to experience everything carried over to so many other aspects of her life.  She always took pride in her knowledge of trivia.  However, her knowledge of music, politics, international travel, Joan Crawford movies,
and all sorts of other interesting stuff, was anything but trivial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy would constantly visit the used CD shop in Park Slope, trading in her old music for something new, often just trying out whatever the guy behind the counter recommended.  Sometimes she liked it.  Sometimes she traded
it back the following week.  Either way, she got to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy wasn't just interested in politics.  She was an active participant.  She would call her senator to express concern or praise over some piece of legislation that was being considered.  She would attend protests against
policies she disagreed with, and she would seek out chances to hear local politicians speak.  Her attitudes and actions persuaded me, after having spent 13 years with no party affiliation, to finally join a political party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy brought me to some of the best independent and classic films I've ever seen.  And she brought me to some of the worst contemporary Hollywood films I've seen in a long time.  She was an avid celebrity-spotter who recently
tried to claim David Caruso as a spotting, only to be told by her friends that he wasn't a celebrity anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, Amy and I discovered Brooklyn.  The first summer that we lived in Carroll Gardens, we rode our bikes all over Brooklyn, including many rides through Prospect Park and longer rides to Coney Island, Bay Ridge, and
Sheepshead Bay.  We got to see a side of the city neither of us had ever seen before, including an area of Brooklyn called Midwood that is filled with old Victorian Houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no picture of Amy is complete without talking about the dogs in her life.  The local dogs of Carroll Gardens include a Bassett Hound named Emily and an adorable Pomeranian named Sandy.  Amy and I would routinely
walk a few blocks out of our way just to walk past Sandy's house, in hopes that Sandy might be outside and waiting to be petted.  Amy taught me to love pugs and other dogs with snubbed noses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy welcomed me warmly into her life.  The care and consideration she showed amazed me nearly every day.  She introduced me to friends and family who I now count among the closest people in my life, and who have wholeheartedly
embraced me.  Amy became a close friend of my closest friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the movie &lt;i&gt;Arthur&lt;/i&gt;, Dudley Moore has realized that just having fun is not enough unless you have the right person to share it with.  Amy found many of the right people to share her life with, and I consider
myself lucky to have been counted among them.  I guess I was in her &amp;quot;desert island&amp;quot; movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we leave here today, we will reenter a world that seems somewhat less fun, somewhat less loving, somewhat less musical, and somewhat less political, all for having lost Amy.  She will will live on in our memories, and
in the actions and feeling which she impacted while she was with us.  The love that she created in this world has been planted within our hearts, and will continue to grow.  She will be dearly missed, but she will never be forgotten.  Her smile, her laugh, her love, her strength - these things I will keep in my heart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Karen Ann Martin''' (1961-2001) was a 40 year old [[en:flight attendant|flight attendant]] from [[en:Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers, Massachusetts]].  Her brother, Paul Martin, is a computer programmer for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.  Martin died [[en:September 11, 2001|September 11, 2001]] on board [[American Airlines Flight 11]].  

Both Karen's parents had passed away and she was dedicated to keeping her remaining family close and helping her younger sister, who has learning difficulties, become educated and self-sufficient. Karen and her siblings were very close to their aunt who passed away from a heart attack on the morning of September 11, 2001 after the confirmation of Karen's death was realized. Those of us from the Danvers area who knew Karen weren't surprised to hear that she lost her life trying to fend off the terrorists from entering the cockpit and assuming control of Flight 11. As we understand it, she was the first victim of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. She was on the first plane that hit the WTC, and had her throat slit by one of the terrorists as she tried to protect her crew and passengers.

==Tributes==
Few will ever understand who Karen was.  We grew up together...across the street from one another.  We were all mutual components in our lives.  Karen had the toughest road in childhood I ever knew.  Through all the challenges and difficulties, she led her siblings with purpose and strength.  She had that special toughness at the ready that I have rarely seen in anyone. 

I was not at all surprised to hear that she stood-up to the terrorists.  That was simply fundamental to her nature.  And I could not even deal with her death.  I did not deal with it until Karen's sister Susan told me of her death at a coffee shop 3-months later.  I fell appart right then and there in public, and Karen stood strong against a real nightmare.  To call you a &quot;true hero&quot; Karen would not do justice to all that you were.

At our 20th HS reunion Karen and I discussed the pending birth of my first child.  She was so excited for my wife and I.  I'm so sorry you never got to meet him Karen.  He's wonderful.  I tell him about you often.

This was not supposed to happen!  Especially to you!

I can't write any more.

Rob Brown of Danvers

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is with a profound sense of sadness that I write this letter.  On [[September 11, 2001|September 11th, 2001]] the lives of my entire family were changed forever.  My beloved brother, '''Donald Thomas Jones II''', age 39 was lost in Building One of the [[World Trade Center]].  He was a loving husband to Michele and a devoted father to his daughter Taylor Nicole, age 5 and his son, Donald Thomas III, age 2.  He was a caring son to grieving parents, Judith and Donald Jones, son-in law to Carol and Felix Ramirez and brother in law to Christopher Ramirez.  He dearly loved his aunts Linda Zielke and Marjorie McSpirit and his uncles Ed McSpirit and Robert Sutton, and was a tremendous cousin, nephew and friend to many others. We are a close family and for the sake of his legacy, his children, we will do what he would ask of us, take care of one another. 

My brother was an Executive Vice President in the Municipal Bond Department of [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]] on the l04th floor of Building One of the World Trade Center.  He survived the bombing of the World Trade Center in l993, and was called a hero in many New York newspapers as he calmly lead many down a darkened stairwell over l00 floors, (including a pregnant woman who was in labor) to safety.  I am sure he tried to do the same for his co-workers again this time. That was the kind of man he was.

He moved with his family this past March to Billingsley Drive, just around the corner from where he grew up.  He was delighted that his daughter was starting Collins School in the same kindergarten classroom he attended.  We will never forget the wonderful people on his street, many of whom he had yet to meet. The Hollis family, the Brenners, the Maxwells, the Place family, the Heicklens and so many more all coming in every day with food and kindness to try to bolster our spirits, while we waited. 

We were also supported by our wonderful friends Elaine, Donna, George and Karen Reinhardt, Sue and Ed Luigori, Dana and Gary Marshuetz. His wonderful Newark Academy friends, Jim Borkan and Mike Melillo.who have been with us every day.  The Lopomos, the Bonsmas, the Cantors, the Collins School mothers the PTA and Officer Chuck Granata of the Livingston Police Department have all helped ease our suffering. Reverend Long of the Federated Church spent time with us and prayed with us at the beginning of this ordeal, when we needed his prayers. The employees of St. Barnabas Hospital helped us with their kind words and generosity.  My brother's many friends from the Northfield Townhouses in West Orange including Elaine Sugerman, the Patels and Paul and Ava Goldstein stopped by repeatedly and offered their comfort and support.  Pip Printing on Route 10 in Livingston assisted me, at no cost, in preparing flyers with my brother's picture, which I posted throughout New York during our search. Trays of food were sent from Chuck Tahaney at the Town Hall, Joe Roberts and the Town Building Department, Prudential Real Estate Associates, the employees of Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales, Joseph Zahn, Shelly Umanoff and Gail Lowenstein of Gail Lowenstein Real Estate, Marty Writt, Frank and Shirley Goehringer and  Ochs Cider Mill.  Countless others stopping by with cookies, donuts or that big hug that we so desperately needed.   I'm sure there are many who I can't remember, but you know who you are and we love you for caring for us. I know we will never be able to adequately thank you.

I would also like to thank my wonderful cousin Lauren Zielke, who spent days tending to my brothers' children giving love and kindness and patience where it was needed. She was and is our rock to lean on each and every day.

Finally, I would like to thank my dear friend Steve Avetzek, and my cousins, Edward Otto Zielke, Stephen McSpirit and Jason Zielke.  For 2 days we searched countless sites in New York City, including hospitals and the armory to find my brother.  We walked hundreds of blocks when we weren't allowed to drive.  After we ran out of places to search and came home, my cousin, Stephen, a Patrolman on the Livingston Police Department went back and spent nearly a week without rest working tirelessly with the rescue crews digging in the rubble to find his cousin.  No greater gift could my brother have received than his cousin's love and dedication. I will always remember their expressions of love for this great man, my brother.  I will miss him all the days of my life. May he rest in peace.


William B. Jones II

I have been writing this over and over for one year. It was selfish but Wally was more than a friend. He was an honest, loyal, caring, father and husband. He made people that were around better because it was never about him. He lived his life from the heart and that is why everyone that knew him felt like Wally was their best friend. When we stood together I was dwarfed, not by his size although he was 6'4'' and 250 lbs but his heart and presence. I am a better person for knowing him but a selfish person for wanting more. I hope people remember him for how he lived not how he died. Wally knew that the picture was in the heart. Wally will always be in my heart.

      <text xml:space="preserve">FRANK THOMAS &quot;F.T.&quot; AQUILINO

&quot;MADE THE ORDINARY, EXTRAORDINARY&quot; 

Written by: Tara Chiari (Aquilino)- Sister

'''Frank Thomas Aquilino''' (F.T.), a 26 year old vice president with [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]]'s TradeSpark Division and the firm's youngest partner, was not supposed to be on the 105th floor on September 11, 2001.  He was supposed to be driving to [[w:Hartford, CT|Hartford, CT]] for a business meeting.  But after living a truly magnanimous life, it was confirmed that F.T.'s luck had run out.  A business partner had been in contact with F.T. at his desk nearly minutes before the first plane hit the first tower.  For a young man who had found his way out of every sticky situation in the past, it just didn't seem possible that F.T. couldn't find his way out of this one.  

As someone who approached life fearlessly, his family says F.T. would only leave this world with a big bang.  In an event that doesn't make sense, it does make sense that F.T.'s last moment would be part of an historic event.

Although taken from this world at too young an age, the Staten Island resident had accomplished more in his 26 years than most can hope to achieve in a lifetime -- personally and professionally.  It seemed there was nothing F.T. could not accomplish, whether making a million dollar deal, planning a fun night out with friends, or developing his online gambling website, UBetWhat.com.  He had the personality and charm that made others follow him instinctively.   Never afraid to try anything, F.T. had a reputation for making the ordinary, extraordinary. 

The first entry in F.T.'s journal perhaps best captures the essence of who he strived to become:  &quot;These are ideas, inventions, and thoughts that I have and live every day.  My goal is to become the most successful person, first and always with my family and secondly financially.&quot;  It's the family's blessing that in his short life, F.T. saw his dreams come true.  

A scholarship fund has been established at F.T.'s Alma Mater, York College.  
Donations may be made to:

He was a bright young guy who loved everybody and would help anyone who needed it. He was the best friend a person could have. We all miss him and so does the world who never knew him. I am sure that till the end frank was helping others instead of helping himself. Frank was a God loving person who would perform acts of kindness to the homeless and forgotten.

We all miss you!!!

He was killed in the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attack on the [[World Trade Center]]. He was on the 101st floor.

He is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and two children, Jessica, 14, and Matthew, 2. He so enjoyed the [[en:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]] that he taped every show and was nicknamed &quot;Bart&quot;. He was also a big fan of [[en:John Elway|John Elway]] and the Broncos.

==Tributes==
Thomas Damaskinos was a man who loved his family and friends.  He was a man who could make anyone laugh, and often did. 

His friends called him Bart because of his love for the simpsons.

Tom worked at Cantor on the 101st floor along with many friends.  He was such a huge fan of the Broncos and John Elway.  His favorite t.v. show was the simpsons, he taped every single one, and his family tapes them now since he is unable to.  

He had a wife, Jennifer, and two beautiful children, Jessica, 14, and Matthew, 2.  He loved them very much.  He grew up in a house with four brothers, Tommy was the baby.  

He had so many wonderful things about him that I could go on forever, nobody can ever come close to how great he was.

Tom was such a great person who always put others before himself, Tom is missed greatly.

I never got a chance to thank you dad, for all of the things you've done for me.. I will forever love you and cherish our memories..love you more more more said it first...

I Love You Dad, 

your little girl..

Neil was my upstairs neighbor.  He was a good man.  Whenever I am reminded of that terrible day, I always wonder if, for just that one day while hearing him come downstairs at 6:30 a.m., I could've just grabbed him and said that today he was going to be late for work whether he liked it or not -- for no reason.  But, alas, I am neither psychic nor spontaneously crazy.  

Every year on Sept. 11, I contemplate at his memorial outside our building in Hoboken.  He is the human connection I have to the event, thinking about how he was only just going to work.

Pete, you remember me, Tony Barone's friend, used to hang out with Kevin McHale. I just read Wolfie's letter and I remember Wolfie working out at Bethpage HS and I remember his brother at Sal's Pizza. Last I saw you I was probably drunk walking the streets of Bethpage; I most remember the day in front of Tony's house when you told us you were bench pressing &quot;about 190&quot;, we were only in HS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Lorraine G. Bay.jpg|thumb|190px|Lorraine Bay]] 

'''Lorraine G. Bay''' was a flight attendant on [[United Airlines Flight 93]]. She grew up in Levittown, Pennsylvania and was living in East Windsor, New Jersey. Lorraine was an employee of United Airlines for forty years.

Although she had no children of her own, Lorraine Bay watched over her brood of fellow United Airlines flight attendants like a mother. 

A 37-year United veteran, she had chosen Flight 93 over another flight because it was nonstop.

She badgered her co-workers about getting their medical check-ups, bought clothes for people and even sent attractive hats to friends who were undergoing chemotherapy.

No event was too small to escape her notice. She lavished Gummi Bears on the son of a colleague and was known for taking her camera to gatherings and printing multiple copies of the pictures to pass around.

Bay also routinely sent an avalanche of greeting cards for all occasions. Two ill colleagues received cards after her death that were postmarked Sept. 11, indicating that she had probably dropped them in the mail that morning from the airport.

&quot;There wasn't a kinder, more considerate person on the face of the earth&quot;, fellow flight attendant Patricia Morris said. &quot;I don't know what Hallmark is going to do. They're going to go bankrupt&quot;.

With 37 years on the job, Bay was fourth in seniority out of the roughly 700 flight attendants who work for United out of Newark, N.J.

Born across the state line in Bucks County, Pa., she joined the airline when being a flight attendant still carried a certain cachet. Based in San Francisco for her first three years on the job, she headed east and was thereafter based at Newark for the rest of her career.

Priding herself on her appearance, Bay routinely got up in the middle of the night for a 7 a.m. flight to make herself up just so. She would let her husband of 22 years, Erich, sleep in their East Windsor, N.J. home while she drove herself to work.

Bay loved to fly and took pains to put passengers at ease. 

&quot;She was like everyone's favorite aunt who came to visit, brought you a present, talked to you, spent time with you&quot;, said Mary Bush, who by merit of her position as the most senior United flight attendant at Newark had known Bay for more than 30 years. &quot;She was that way to passengers, too&quot;. 

Altering herself like a chameleon changes colors, Bay would match her personality to connect with children, senior citizens and everyone in between who came under her ministrations during a trip.

&quot;Work&quot;, Bush said, &quot;was a love affair for her&quot;. 

She is survived by her husband, Erich.

==Tributes==
Lorraine,
I remember being a passenger on one of your flights.  I will always remember your beautiful smile and the love you seemed to have for your job.   I will always think of you on Sept. 11th.  May you rest in peace.  Heaven is blessed because you are now an angel smiling on us.
Vicky Jones

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''John Ogonowski''', American pilot and agricultural activist. He was the captain of [[American Airlines Flight 11]], which crashed in the [[en:September 11, 2001 Attack]]. A resident of [[en:Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut, Massachusetts]], he was a leading figure on behalf of farming in [[en:Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], particularly for immigrant farmers from [[en:Cambodia|Cambodia]] who he assisted as part of the [[en:New Entry Sustainable Farming Project|New Entry Sustainable Farming Project]]. He had just celebrated his birthday.  He was survived by his wife Peggy, their three children, (Mary Catherine 11, Caroline 14, and Laura 16) as well as by his brother Jim, and parents.  His brother Jim stated the 150-acre land owned by John would be preserved as open space, as John would have preferred.

Any contributions in memory of him should be sent to the following address:

''Dracut Land Trust, Inc.&lt;br&gt; c/o The Enterprise Bank and Trust Co.&lt;br&gt; 1168 Lakeview Ave.&lt;br&gt; Dracut, MA 01826''

==Tributes==
Hugh Joseph, Tufts University:
:John Ogonowski was the pilot on American Airlines Flight 11 to Los Angeles that crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City this morning.  At this time of immense tragedy, all our hearts go out to his wife Peggy, to their children and to other family and friends.  But it is also a time to remember John for his generous efforts on behalf of farming in Massachusetts, and particularly for immigrant farmers from Cambodia who he assisted as part of the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project.

:John became involved with this project at its very inception over three years ago, when Paul Fischer of Farm Service Agency in Westford contacted him looking for land to make available for Southeast Asian families living in nearby Lowell who wanted to farm.  John recognized this immediately as an opportunity to help a worthy group of beginning growers to practice another kind of agriculture.  He not only made land behind his home available to these farmers, but became our first &quot;mentor farmer&quot; for commercial growers.  In practice he was involved in every program activity on his farm.  He tilled the land and fertilized it with well-aged compost he would have otherwise used for his own crops. He excavated a pond for irrigation, and set up an irrigation system connected to it and to existing wells.  He ordered materials and set up a greenhouse so the growers could raise seedlings and do extended season production.  He provided advice on managing production, pest control, harvesting and other production practices.  He participated at project steering committee meetings; in fact, he and Peggy hosted a number of these meetings at their wonderful home where they would serve dishes made from farm grown vegetables and fruits in additional to other great foods.

:All John Ogonowski was asked to do was to rent land to these growers, which he did.  But he'd rarely collect the rents and he did so much else for the growers that took up his time and created out-of-pocket expense for which he often never asked for reimbursement.  John did all this while he was a full time pilot for American Airlines, while he raised his own crops on an additional 200 acres spread around Dracut, and while he raised three wonderful children.  He was a founder and active member of a local land trust that has helped to save a substantial amount of local farmland in Dracut from development.  This year, the land trust negotiated the purchase of about 50 acres of land about a mile from his house.  With John's own land out of commission due to a major gas line installation, he made that land available to our project and because of that a dozen new  growers got a new start farming this year.

:John was interviewed by Susan Shepherd of NPR's Living on Earth just a few weeks ago.  In that interview he talked at length about how much he loved to farm and how he got involved with the immigrant farming program because he wanted to offer it to others who also loved agriculture.  He praised the hard work of the  participating Cambodian families and how it meant a lot to him to be able to offer them this opportunity.

:August Schumacher, Jr., former USDA Undersecretary of Agriculture  and one of the founders of the New Entry Sustainable Farming  Project, was, like everyone who know him, tremendously anguished by this catastrophic event:
:&quot;John Ogonowski's tragic death is a terrible loss to Peggy, their children and his wonderful parents and to so many in Massachusetts farming.  He was so committed to helping immigrant farmers, to assist new immigrants from war torn Asia to make a better life farming in America.  I just think how ironic it is that someone who worked so hard to help victims of terrorism should be brought down by an act of terrorism himself.  He will be sorely missed.&quot;

:John was a generous friend and partner to us all - and we will indeed miss him greatly.

'''Vijayashanker Paramsothy''' died in the South Tower of the World Trade Center after making a decision to stay to help others. He worked for [[Aon Corporation]].  After the first plane had hit the north tower, Mr. Paramsothy and a number of his Aon colleagues made their way down to the 78th floor sky lobby of the south tower. This floor was an elevator and information hub. At 9:03am it was packed with people trying to decide what to do. At this moment, the second plane impacted the south tower at the 78th floor. Of the approximately 150 people who had been milling around the elevator banks, all but approximately 20 were killed immediately or mortally injured. Mr. Paramsothy was relatively unhurt. He began gathering the survivors among the Aon people, including colleague Judy Wein. According to Ms. Wein, a man with a red handkerchief began instructing those who could leave to do so immediately and those who wanted to help get other people out to come with him. Mr. Paramsothy went with the man. Vijay, as he was known to all, presumably died in the tower's collapse fifty minutes later.

He was born in [[en:Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford, Connecticut]] and attended Housatonic Valley Regional High School, [[en:Paul Smith's College|Paul Smith's College]] and the University Without Walls at the [[en:University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He was a computer research specialist for the Office of Information Technologies (OIT) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst since November 2000. He was a resident of [[en:Turners Falls, Massachusetts|Turners Falls, Massachusetts]]. Carstanjen had previously been employed at the Northfield Mount Hermon School from 1996 to 2000. Since starting work at UMass he had been OIT's liaison to the UMass College of Humanities and Fine Arts, providing support and consultation to the College's departments in all aspects of OIT services. He was a great guy, an avid dancer (morris and contra) and loved motorcycling.  To friends he was known as &quot;Captain Tupperware&quot; in reference to his red fully-faired Honda Pacific Coast 800 which proudly bore a &quot;Body by Tupperware&quot; decal.  Chris was on his way for vacation to California for the annual Great Pacific Coast Motorcycle Ride when he was lost on Flight 175.

==Tributes==
UMass Chancellor Marcellette G. Williams: 
:The confirmation that Christoffer was aboard the flight that struck the second tower adds the piercing pain of familiarity to the profound sadness that his UMass family members are experiencing. We extend our arms and our hearts to Christoffer's family in the hope of providing some solace to their pain. Christoffer's sense of the human dimension of technology is one of the many enduring gifts he has given us. To him and to his family we say, 'Thank You.' His life has made ours the richer.

Randy Sailer, director of telecommunications for OIT:
:Christoffer was extremely outgoing and friendly, and very popular within OIT. He worked well with both faculty and students and was a great ambassador for the University.

Alice Taylor, Rock Creek Morris Women:
:Five years on, we remember the joy we shared with Chris and with dancer Steve Adams, also lost, when we danced, sang, and drank at the Marlboro Morris Ale. 9-11-06

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; M. Lewin''' was a [[en:mathematician|mathematician]] and entrepreneur. He died at the age of 31 on [[American Airlines Flight 11]] during the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks, after allegedly being shot or stabbed.  According to news reports of a phone call from flight attendant [[Betty Ong|Betty Ann Ong]], to Amy Sweeny at Logan International Airport, as Sweeny reported in turn to her manager, Michael Woodward, Lewin was sitting in seat 9B, and had his throat cut by the passenger in seat 10B at approximately 8:20. That passenger in 10B was later identified as [[en:Satam al-Suqami|Satam al-Suqami]].  The claim that Mr. Lewin was shot has been traced to an FAA memo outlining the sequence of events surrounding the hijacking, but has been repudiated on this point of fact by the FAA subsequently. 

Danny Lewin co-founded [[en:Akamai Technologies|Akamai Technologies]], Inc. in [[en:Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and was the Chief Technical Officer (CTO) and a board member. At the time of his death, he was a Ph.D. candidate at [[en:Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and a resident of Brookline, Massachusetts. 
He was said to have become a paper-billionaire when Akamai stock first became available.

Lewin was born in [[en:Denver|Denver]], [[en:Colorado|Colorado]] and raised in [[en:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[en:Israel|Israel]], where he served in [[en:Sayeret Matkal|Sayeret Matkal]], a counter-terrorism unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, and graduated from Technion.  He held dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship. After working at the IBM Haifa research laboratory, he moved to the United States.  He was survived by his wife and two sons.

His parents visited him from Israel in the week before his flight.

My name is Valentina, and at my school St.Cecilia's in CA, we had names picked out for people to pray for during the World Trade Center Attacks. I was in grade five. I chose John Wenckus. Today, on the fifth anniversary of 9-11, I went to Google and thought that maybe there would be an off chance of finding information on him, and there was. Now, I am in 8th grade, I know a little about him and his family. Thank you, and may God bless you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Joanne Marie Ahladiotis''' was born on June 10, 1974 in Rocky Point, New York to Eleni and Miltiadis Ahladiotis. 

She was a Greek American. She resided in Forest Hills, Queens. She had big brown eyes and dark thick hair and the most amazing dimples in the world. She stood about 5'2 and weighed 110 pounds. Joanne was well known for her radiant smile. Her smile can brighten the room and make everyone feel better. Joanne was always smiling. She was a very positive person and was a great inspiration to everyone she met.

Joanne was a very caring person and was a role model to her cousin Roula Galanakis. They shared a passion for shopping, talking a mile a minute, cooking and they both were really caring to everyone and they liked to try new recipes. She dressed impeccably and had her nails done once a week. 

Joanne worked as a manager for the financial services company for eSpeed. She was a graduate of the class of 1992, she was regarded as a  well-rounded and dynamic person. Her interests were diverse, ranging from the study of Modern Greek and playing on the field hockey team to performing in the high school musical and working on the school's yearbook.

She visited her grandmother every two years. Whenever Joanne would visit her grandmother in Greek she would go sunbathing. The last time Joanne seen her grandmother. Her grandmother started crying because she thought she would never see Joanne again because of her aging. They both started crying and Joanne said:
                       &quot;Yia-Yia Dont Cry...I will be back soon&quot;
Unfortunately that word was broken on September 11th. 

She was only twenty-seven years old when she perished in the World Trade Center disaster. Joanne was attending a 7 a.m. meeting on the 104th of the North Tower. She would always go to work at 9 a.m. but went to work two hours early on [[September 11, 2001|September 11th]] for a meeting. A week before her death she invited her parents to Las Vegas to accompany her on a business trip. 

Joanne is survived by her parents, Miltiadis and Eleni, her sister Effie, and several aunts, uncles and cousins throughout the New York area, the United States, Canada and Greece. May her memory be eternal!

Joanne I will always love you no matter what. Thank you for being such a guidance for me. I love you more than life itself and I cant wait to see you in heaven. I miss you with all my heart. I will NEVER EVER forget you Joanne. Even though you may still be gone I still look up to you. LOVE YA!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Rosanne P. Lang''' died on September 11, 2001 at age 42. 

Lang was honored by [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]] as their nominee to the YWCA Academy of Women Achievers, 1998.

As daughter to Rose &amp; Bill, sister to Bill, Paula, Pat, Jamus, Jennifer, Gary, Barbara, Margaret, Timothy, Kelly, Marty, Linda, Donald, Jodi, Matthew, Kathy, Gerard, Judy, Richard, Grace, Donna &amp; Al and MaryLou; friend and Aunt to many including Brendan Lang, also lost in the WTC, and Linda M from San Francisco, Rosanne personified love, laughter, generousity and genuine goodness of heart. In everything she did and everyone who's soul she touched, she left a most cherished and indelible mark.

While incredibly heartbroken by the deaths of Rosanne and Brendan, we have to remember that God had given them to us to love and cherish. They had an impact on each and everyone one of us, that can only be appreciated by those they loved and who loved them.  

Had it not been for God and His great generousity, we would never have been blessed with having Rosanne and Brendan in our lives, or knowing and loving them as the beautiful people they were.

Rosanne, you will live on in the hearts of those who loved you most dearly forever.  Those who ignore your memory for the sake of materialistic pursuits should suffer in loneliness and pain for an eternity.  May God have mercy on their souls.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''James Joseph (Joe) Ferguson''' (19XX-September 11, 2001) was the director of geography education outreach for the [[en:National Geographic Society|National Geographic Society]] in [[en:Washington, D.C.|Washington]] He developed educational programs for schools and took children on field trips to exotic places.

He died at age 39 aboard [[American Airlines Flight 77]] during the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks.

He was on the first leg of a trip to the Channel Islands in California, where he was to conduct an educational field trip.

He was survived by his mother, Barbara Harrell, brother Randy Ferguson and sister-in-law, Jennifer Ferguson of Mississippi. According to his friends, he loved clothes, his dog Winston, cooking, music and dancing. David Merlin Duke, a friend in Nashville, says, &quot;[w]hen Joe got up in the morning, first thing he'd do was blast the music. He'd dance while he got dressed, and I mean he ''dressed''. Joe didn't have clothes -- he had 'outfits'.&quot;

&quot;I was a student on an 'educational field trip' with Joe (Project Marco Polo) in 1994. I remember his love of music and good food. I also remember that he and Ann Judge, another passenger that day on flight 77, were a brilliant team, leading us through Italy, Malta, and Tunisia.  Not only did they make sure everything went smoothly, but they conducted the trip with a sense of style, grace, and humour. I will never forget that trip or the horrible events on 9/11/01.&quot; ~Meghan Spyker, 23, Music Therapist in San Francisco, CA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Todd Beamer''' was one of the heroes of [[United Airlines Flight 93]]. Todd was speaking to a Verizon airphone supervisor, Lisa Jefferson, from the doomed Flight 93 stating that he and others were going to do something to stop the hijackers. Whether or not they gained control of the airplane, we will never know. The plane went down in a field in Pennsylvania, preventing another disaster in the making.  He is survived by his children and wife Lisa.

Todd's famous last words were &quot;Let's roll&quot; a phrase used by many still today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Thomas Dowd''', 37, Monroe, N.Y., was a bond broker with [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities]].

We don't want to leave here today without trying to convey to all of you how much Tommy meant to us. As he was the youngest by far in our family of 7 children, we all remember the day Tommy was born. Without exception it is remembered as a day of great excitement and joy.

Friday evening, April 17, 1964, we were all anxiously waiting to hear if we had a boy or a girl. The boys, Raymond and Gerard were happy to have another join their ranks. The girls, Dorothy, MaryLou, Diane and Joan were just happy to have a new baby to coddle. Even our parents seemed to feel this surprise baby was more about joy then any added burden in their already large family.

From the beginning Tommy lived up to that moment. He continued to bring us joy throughout his life. We believed he was the most adorable boy ever. We spoiled him with love and affection and he accepted it gracefully. We could never tell if he was naturally wonderful or if all that love made him that way. (Maybe it was a combination).

Our neighbors referred to him as the Mayor of Inwood and indeed he made friends wherever he went. He would introduce himself and our mother saying, &quot;Hi, I'm Tom and this is Mae.&quot; Tommy was truly the light of all of our lives.

We feel that Tommy will live in our hearts forever. Our children have grown up hearing &quot;Tommy stories&quot;. They will in turn tell their children these stories about how much their parents and aunts and uncles loved their little brother. He will live on in our family story.

It is somewhat comforting that Raymond managed to contact him on that terrible day and Tommy was once again connected to the love of his family. We cherish having Kerri, Heather, Thomas and Brittany as part of Tommy with us still. We pray that he is at peace in God's loving care.

== Tributes and Comments ==

Cathy had a love for many things. She loved animals, music, and travelling. In her younger days, she chased rock stars like Robert Plant and The Black Crowes often getting their autographs and pictures. My sister loved animals. She worked part-time as a veterinary assistant. She was very adventurous. She liked mountain biking and even tried sky diving once. She was a caring person who often put the needs of her family and friends before her own. Cathy enjoyed horror movies and horror novels, especially Ann Rice novels. She enjoyed Tai Chi. She loved taking pictures of people and places that she tarvelled. She loved poems by Thoreau and once travelled to Walden Pond. She was godmother to her niece Nicole and Breanna, a friend's daughter. She loved celebrating holidays, especially Halloween. She would go all out with her costumes and wear false teeth and contact lenses. I consider my sister to be brave and courageous like the many people that she worked with. She was brave enough to return to the World Trade Center after the first bombing.

Cathy was an important link in our family chain. Through her, family members kept in contact. I know that Cathy would agree with me when I say don't mourn for her. Honor her life! You can do this by honoring the people she loved, listen to the music she loved, read the books she loved, and love the people she loved. My sister was one of the most caring and loving people I ever knew. 

- written by her brother, Michael.

Cathy was loved by many people, and her loss has affected many across our country. The world prays for her and her family, particularly sister Lucy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Douglas Stone''' was an [[en:United States|American]] print shop owner. He died at age 54 in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] on [[September 11, 2001]]. A native New Englander and resident of Dover, New Hampshire, Stone owned and operated Odyssey Press. He often visited [[en:Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] to see a business associate, his ex-wife Beth Stone, and his son, Zach. He graduated from California State Long Beach, returning to New England in the late 1980s after he divorced.

On many visits he watched his son Zach compete in track and cross-country for Fountain Valley High School. On this flight he was coming to see his son begin his freshman year at [[en:UCLA|UCLA]].

[[talk:Douglas_Stone|Tributes and Comments]]

----

Zach Stone, son:
:He was a really honest, straightforward person. I used to tell people that he wasn't a fake person. He told you what he thought.


He was one of the finest men I ever knew. I often thought of him and his family. I wish I could have been half the man he was. For so long confused strength with physical strength. Doug, had a strength that surpassed my understanding. I will never forgive myself for not knowing him better and for not being more like him. 


As a business colleague, I didn't know him all that well, but the small part of him I knew, I valued. His personality came through on even the most mundane of interactions--quoting prices, dealing with billing--he was a pleasure to work with and after five years, I still miss him. EP

      <text xml:space="preserve">Staff Sgt. '''Maudlyn A. White''', 38, St. Croix, Virgin Islands, was a member of the U.S. Army. She died in the [[Pentagon]].

Maudlyn and I were class mates at Stayer University. She was majoring in Computer Science at the time.  As a matter of fact, we were classmates in the last two classes she had to complete before receiving her Bachelor's degree.  She would always say, &quot;Jennifer, this is my last computer class and I will be out of here!&quot; laced with that Carribbean accent I always loved to hear.  I would laugh and she would bounce back to her seat to give the instructor some more of her great sense of humor before the break ended.

Maudlyn was a go-getter.  She worked full-time, attended school full-time and was a single mom.  I truly miss her and pray for her and her daughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Thomas Barnes Reinig''' was lost at the [[World Trade Center]] on [[September 11, 2001]]. Reinig, 48, was vice president of the eSpeed Software Solutions division of [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]] and a resident of Bernardsville, New Jersey. 

Tom is survived by his wife, Jeanne Fattori Reinig, and two sons, Christopher and Scott.


&quot;Persistence, determination and love were personified in every aspect of my father's life. Starting a family in northern New Jersey, he constantly sacrificed himself for the benefit of those he loved. Always traveling wherever his work took him, his heartfelt dedication to everything in his life was obvious at all times to everyone who knew him. Working hard was always important to my father, yet never at the cost of spending time with his family. A model dad, he encouraged my mother, brother and me to aim high, by leading us with the example he set. 

&quot;Riding chair lifts with us on the ski slopes, swimming with us at the town pool, coaching our sports teams, cheering for us during competitions, getting frustrated over poor golf shots with us, competing alongside us in triathlons, and pushing us to excel in school -- never once did he leave our side. 

&quot;Fighting all the pressures of the business world to put work first and everything else second, my father never let his job get the best of him. Rather, it only brought out the best. The idea that working hard and playing even harder was a rule of thumb, he did whatever was required of him to ensure that he could do just that. 

&quot;We'll certainly miss all the great times, the steak dinners, the vacations, but most of all, you and your drive to make things perfect, just as they were. Smiling, a Reinig tradition, is what we'll continue doing. I'm sure anyone who ever met my father and our family knows that all he would want from us is for us to remain smiling. We can't cry because it's over, but we can smile because it happened. Thanks dad, for everything.&quot; 

''-Scott Reinig, son ''

&quot;Tom and I worked together for a number of years at Lehman Brothers. Always very professional and enthusiastic, Tom was especially helpful to me when, as a second year associate, I was asked to start the derivatives and financing business at Lehman in Japan - at the time a small office of 20 people. Whenever he was asked to help out on a project he was responsive and responsible. I have lost contact with Tom since he left Lehman but remember his cheerful and enthusiastic demeanor fondly. As we were the same age, his untimely passing has personally affected me and has made me think hard of how I am living my life.&quot; 

''-Gary Talarico, former colleague''

&quot;Tom sat in the desk next to me in high school..He was very bright,hard working,understanding person....Tom was a true AMERICAN in every way..... My heart goes out to his family ..GOD BLESS YOU&quot;

''-Richard Ring, classmate''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deborah Jacobs Welsh''' was a United Airlines flight attendant. She lived in Hell's Kitchen in New York with her husband, Patrick, and her Dalmatian. Welsh had been a flight attendant for over twenty-five years and had worked for United Airlines for the last four years. Before that she had worked at other airlines including the defunct Eastern Airlines and Kiwi Airlines. She was a member of the choir at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York.

Patrick Welsh, who lived with Deborah on Manhattan's West Side, knows his wife was terrified when the hijackers commandeered Flight 93. &quot;Like anybody would be&quot;, he said.

&quot;I know in that horrible takeover, she stepped up. The flag was on the ground and she picked it up and so did the others on the plane&quot;, he voiced.

Authorities believe passengers may have attempted to wrest control of the aircraft from the hijackers. Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania, Flight 93 might well have been steered into a national landmark, like the jetliners which crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Patrick Welsh said his wife was not shy about expressing herself and would have said, &quot;what the terrorists thought was a triumphant battle cry from Allah was actually a pathetic whimper of cowardice.&quot;

&quot;She wouldn't want a knee-jerk reaction or vigilantism, and I know she would want that expressed,&quot; he said.

The couple had spent the evening before the fatal flight at a New York comedy club. &quot;We loved to laugh&quot;, he said.

And laughter, it seems, will become Deborah Welsh's legacy.

&quot;When she walked into a room, the party started,&quot; said Coral Mary Southam, a friend from Los Angeles.

He said she would want people &quot;to get back to going to movies, to buying hot dogs or a CD&quot;. 

&quot;But in the big picture, she'd want us to make sure the planes keep going. She loved this industry&quot;.

Welsh died at age 49 in the crash of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] on [[September 11, 2001]]. She was not regularly scheduled to fly this route and had swapped shifts with a co-worker.

Welsh is survived by her husband, Patrick.

== Tributes ==
When I was based at EWR I flew with Debbie often.  We were around the same seniority so we would end up on alot of the same trips. We flew together for an entire month one time and we got to know each other pretty well.  What can I say.  Debbie is an unforgetable person.  Just seeing her would make you light up.  She brought so much joy and energy to work with her. She was so giving too.  If she found a delicious muffin at some bakery in the city, the next day she would bring in a whole bunch to share with people at work. She was funny, interesting and unique. I think of her often.  She is greatly missed. --Debbie Brandewiede

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Jeffrey Dwayne Collman''' was one of nine [[American Airlines Flight 11]] flight attendants, a [[Casualties of the September 11, 2001 attacks: plane passengers|victim]] of the [[September 11, 2001|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]].  He was born in Yorkville, Illinois on September 28, 1959, but had lived in Novato, California for the last four years with his partner, Keith Bradkowski.  

Though the third year American employee usually worked on only Boston-to-San Francisco flights, Collman had switched to Flight 11's Boston-to-Los Angeles route for the month of September because of vacation plans involving his upcoming birthday.

Collman was an aspiring chef with a love of preparing dessert dishes and enjoyed flying for his work.  He received the American Professional Flight Attendant Award in 1999. He was also a tennis fan and had attended the 2001 United States Open days before his passing.

At the time of his death, he was survived by his partner, his step-mother, four brothers and a sister. 

Keith Bradkowski described Collman as courageous and safety-conscious, saying, &quot;He was so focused on safety, if there was a threat, he would have done anything in his power to prevent it.&quot;  Collman had spoken to Bradkowski on September 10, saying he was excited about his vacation. Bradkowski has become a spokesperson of sorts for gay rights and same-sex partner benefits since his spouse's death.[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/assignment7/090302_assign7_911_collman.html]

Kay Collman, Jeffrey's stepmother, remembered him as having &quot;had friends all over the world; he was a people person.&quot; She said, &quot;He'd know the life histories of his passengers after just one flight.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:mattrogan.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Matthew Rogan in an undated photo.]]'''Matthew S. Rogan''' (June 20, 1964 – [[September 11, 2001]]) was a New York City firefighter killed in the line of duty on September 11, 2001.

Matthew Rogan was supposed to be off-duty the day the Twin Towers collapsed, but he had switched tours with one of his fellow firefighters at Ladder Co. 11 on the Lower East Side.

Rogan, 37, was a New York City police officer for eight years. Following in the footsteps of his father, John, who was a retired fire captain in New York City, Rogan became a firefighter in 1994.

Rogan was born and raised in West Islip. He was graduated from St. John the Baptist High School and attended Paul Smith's College in upstate New York.

Matthew was considered a humble hero by his friends and family. On Nov. 11, 1997, Rogan and two other firefighters swam 30 to 40 feet, wearing cumbersome bunker gear, to rescue a woman from the frigid East River. As the trio explained the rescue effort to television crews, reporters and city officials, the media-shy Rogan reportedly whispered to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani: &quot;That was harder than the rescue.&quot;

He had a great sense of humor, relatives said. He loved gardening, clamming and spending time with his children.  An avid history enthusiast, he enjoyed watching programs on The History Channel. 

Rogan is survived by his wife, Melissa; children Sarah, Matthew and Monica; parents, John and Marian, and siblings Christopher, Gerard and Bernadette Benenati.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Michael F. Cammarata''' was a New York City firefighter from Staten Island, New York, at 22 the youngest firefighter to die in the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks. After scoring a perfect score on the written and physical exams, he was sworn in as a firefighter and assigned to Ladder Company 11 on East Second Street in June, 2001. His fellow firefighters called him &quot;The Face&quot; for his good looks.

He died while on duty in the collapse of the [[World Trade Center]]. He was last seen going into the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel. 

His remains were not found by the time of his funeral on June 7, 2003. A vial of his donated blood was buried with personal effects.

At the funeral Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that rescue personnel should be particularly identified in any memorial, so that any visitor &quot;be able to read their names, know what they did, appreciate their heroism, be inspired by their sacrifice and ensure they are designated as role models for the next generation who will protect us all.&quot;

He worked as an accountant for Ernst and Young for about a year, before enlisting as a member of the New York City Fire Department.

O'Berg was killed at the age of 28 on [[September 11, 2001]], when the [[World Trade Center]] towers fell as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. O'Berg's father (also Dennis O'Berg, and a firefighter) was known to be onsite at ground zero for weeks after the disaster, in the hopes of finding the remains of his son; he retired the day of (and as a result of) the terrorist attacks. Whether Dennis O'Berg the younger's remains were ultimately found is not known as of this writing.

A memorial service for him, with honors, was held on June 28, 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Henry Brennan''' was born in 1949, the oldest of the six children in the Brennan family.

Growing up in Rockville Center, New York, Brennan quickly grew to be an idol for his younger siblings. At a height of six feet, seven inches, he was a natural basketball player in high school and was nicknamed &quot;Zelmo&quot; after Zelmo Beatty, a popular basketball player at the time.

Brennan's career was jump-started fortuitously as a bouncer at local night clubs on Long Island. Before long, his natural talent allowed him to rise to the position of manager, and before leaving the business he was owner of several clubs, including Solomon Grundy's in Bay Shore.

For the last ten years of his life, Brennan worked as a senior vice president and limited partner at [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]] as a government securities broker. He became an ardent supporter of the New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund headed by Rusty Staub, former New York Mets player and longtime friend.

On September 10, 2001, Staub and Brennan met for the last time to discuss plans for a November benefit for the wives and children of dead firefighters and police officers.

Brennan worked on the one-hundred and fifth floor of the [[World Trade Center]]. On [[September 11, 2001]], he was amongst the thousands killed in a series of terrorist attacks carried out against targets in the United States. He was survived by his wife, mother, five siblings, and ten nieces and nephews.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Graham Berkeley''' (January 12, 1964 - September 11, 2001), a Briton, had lived in the United States for 10 years, and for 10 years he had been trying to get the green card that would grant him resident status. It came at last in June, and Mr. Berkeley had started making plans to move to New York City from Boston when, on [[en:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], he boarded [[United Airlines Flight 175]] for a business trip to [[en:Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

&quot;It's like fate playing tricks on you,&quot; said his friend Christian Winslow. &quot;His fight for that green card had been so intense.&quot;

Mr. Berkeley, 37, was director of e-commerce solutions for the Compuware Corporation, but his friends remember him as a classical violinist, an opera buff and a world traveler. &quot;He loved the freedom that America has,&quot; Mr. Winslow said. &quot;He loved the openness of our society and the friends he had here. America, to Graham, was almost like the cliché — a land of endless opportunities.&quot;

==Tributes==
Graham Berkeley was a musician, a zealot, a raging intelligence, a bon vivant and a clown. He was above all a man who lived in vivid, three-dimensional color that paled much around him to washed-out shades of grey.

Those of us who worked with him were by turns charmed, intimidated and enthralled.

We were blessed and challenged by his presence; we are diminished and bereft by his passing.

May we remember him well and long.
----

I studied at the Royal College of Music with Graham in the early 1980s, and we even lived in the same student hostel (Victoria League Hostel) in Bayswater, West London, for a year.  He was a funny guy.  I remember walking with him to school many days, across Kensington Gardens.  

Graham and I met again in the mid-1990s, when both of us had relocated to New York City.  We literally ran into each other one day on Fifth Avenue, stopped and looked, and realized that we knew each other &quot;from a previous life.&quot;  At that point, he was living on Sixth Avenue, downtown.  He had also &quot;come out.&quot;

I did not find out about his passing until today, November 10, when speaking to my ex-professor at the Royal College of Music.  This is very sad news.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christopher Larrabee''', died [[September 11, 2001]]. 

'''I went to college with Chris at the University of Arizona.''' We were in the Media Arts Department together and majoring in film. Chris was a pretty quiet young man, but when he felt comfortable and opened up he was one of the nicest and funniest people I knew. A few times a group of us went out for drinks after one of our BFA classes and I have to say that young man was fun and spirited. Our senior year one of our professors asked what our plan was once we graduated and if we were prepared. Chris jokingly told the professor, &quot;I've decided film is too competitive...I'm going into porn.&quot; The class burst out with laughter as Chris just sat there grinning. I will never forget that.

When a colleague of ours informed me of his presence in the WTC upon collapse I was stunned. Although I didn't know Chris all that well I worked with him on a few film projects and laughed with him enough to consider him a friend.

May his soul rest in peace.

'''I grew up with Chris''', he lived down the street from me and we attended middle school, high school and 5 years at the University of Arizona together.  Although I cannot say that he was my best friend, certainly a close friend and a life changing one.  Life changing because he and the only larger kid than Chris in 8th grade took it upon themselves to playfully oppress their slightly smaller friends to make them stand up for themselves and stop being &quot;wusses&quot;.  Without this constant good hearted abuse I would have never become the man I am today.  With that and the cherished memories of the &quot;Larrabee Nasal Canon&quot;, Dr. Giggles and countless shots at Dirtbags his loss was devastating to me.  It is a wonderful thing that websites like this can keep his memory living on so that people can understand the senseless loss of a beautiful human being. SRS

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Norma Lang Steuerle''', PhD, 54, Alexandria, Va., was a clinical psychologist. She died aboard [[American Airlines Flight 77]], which crashed into the [[Pentagon]].

Steuerle was beginning a trip to Okinawa, Japan to visit her 28-year-old Navy doctor daughter, Kristin, and meet her husband Gene who was traveling on business. The three were then to travel together to Thailand, where Norma and Gene would have celebrated their 31st anniversary.

She was 54 years old, married to Gene, with two daughters, Lynne, 24, and Kristin, 28.

She had an office in Alexandria, Virginia, where she and her colleagues specialized in working with women and children with depression and AD/HD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and with their families.

&quot;Norma was a particularly gifted family therapist,&quot; says her business partner Susan Biggs, EdD. She had a unique ability to connect with her clients on a fundamental level, says Biggs. &quot;When you worked with Norma as a client or a colleague, you had her complete and undivided attention.&quot;

NORMA LANG STEUERLE, 54, of Alexandria, Va., was a clinical psychologist and someone Carolyn Lawlor, a teacher and school director, could turn to for advice when a student was having trouble. &quot;I always thought of her as a very wise woman,&quot; Lawlor said. &quot;She had that extraordinary ability, when a person walked into her space, to make them feel immediately comfortable, like an old friend.&quot;

&quot;WHEREAS, Norma Steuerle, a native of Pittsburgh, was a clinical psychologist who practiced in Old Town Alexandria and Annandale and specialized in counseling families, couples, and children; and 
WHEREAS, married and the mother of two daughters, Norma Steuerle was valedictorian of her class at Carnegie Mellon University and held a master's degree from Temple University and a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin; and 
WHEREAS, Norma Steuerle was on the first leg of a journey to Japan to rendezvous with her husband and older daughter in the Far East; now, therefore, be it

She was living her dream as she always did. --Kristin Steuerle

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Joseph J. Coppo''', 47, a burly municipal bond trader at [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]], coached all four of his children, and hundreds of other children in New Canaan, Conn.

&quot;He was very demanding, but he was someone you always wanted to work hard for,&quot; said his daughter, Kathleen, 22, who played center field for him on a softball team. This summer, Mr. Coppo coached his youngest son's All-Star baseball team. Theplayers, 13 years old, attended his funeral in their uniforms.

&quot;You don't know Joe Coppo, and you do,&quot; Mike Lupica wrote in ''The Daily News'' two Sundays after the attacks. &quot;Every town, if it is lucky, has somebody like him, the guy who doesn't just want to coach his own kids but all the kids.&quot;

Kathleen Coppo, who described her father as &quot;my best friend, the first person I turned to for anything,&quot; teaches a class on social justice at a small Catholic girls school. Recently one of her students asked her whether Sept. 11 had caused her to abandon her pacifist beliefs. No, she replied -- an answer, she said, that might have pleased her father, who considered applying for conscientious-objector status when he was drafted just as the Vietnam War was ending. &quot;He was not into war,&quot; she said.

Expected fatalities at the [[World Trade Center]]. As of January 22, 2004, the number of presumed dead was 2,749 (including the 147 [[Casualties of the September 11, 2001 attacks: plane passengers|plane casualties]] and ten hijackers).

The following list is based on the August 19, 2002 list released by the City of New York; seven people have since been found alive, including Albert John Vaughan and George V. Sims. The list thus has five names that are not casualties, and will be removed when they are known.

One name on that list, Jeffrey Montgomery, 23, was found later to be apocryphal, made up by the woman who claimed to be his sister.


As of September 13, 2001 9:00 EDT&lt;br&gt;
6291 casualties treated at area hospitals including rescue workers.


As of November 21, 2001, 673 were confirmed dead. 


The September11Victims.com listing has, as of 08/15/04, 2996 entries (including the people killed on the planes and at the Pentagon): 2948 confirmed dead, 24 reported dead, and 24 reported missing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ann Nicole Nelson''' ([[en:17 May|17 May]] [[en:1971|1971]] - [[en:11 September|11 September]] [[en:2001|2001]]) was a bond trader for the [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]] brokerage firm and worked on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's north tower.

She also attended Campus School in [[en:Minot, North Dakota|Minot, North Dakota]], Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, WI, and Carleton College in Northfield, MN.

She has had many tributes and donations made in her honor. Minot State University's concert hall has since been renamed Ann Nicole Nelson Hall, originally George McFarland Hall.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dr. '''William &quot;Bill&quot; E. Caswell''' was a smart physicist who did his undergraduate physics degree at the University of Maryland physics department and his PhD elsewhere.  Some of his work involved summation of Feynman loops for calculation of elementary particle properties.  He died on [[September 11, 2001]].

Caswell eventually left academic work and came to work for the Naval Surface Weapons Center, first at White Oak Maryland, formerly the Naval Ordnance Laboratory.  He was apparently on a naval mission on the day of the tragedy.  His life ended crashing into the Pentagon.

They thought this would be a nice tribute to the people that lost their lives. It has every name of each person that lost their life on [[September 11, 2001]]. This concept was thought up by John and Amy, and totally paid for by them. John says he will be a while paying the loan off that he had to take out to do it but, thought this was the least he could do. Applied Graphics in [[en:Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo, North Dakota]] did most of the work and Paul Kosenski did the hood painting. This truck is awesome. Here is some photos from the owners/operators.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''' LeRoy Wilton Homer, Jr. ''' (1965 - September 11, 2001) was a co-pilot aboard [[United Airlines Flight 93]].

He grew up on [[:en:Long Island|Long Island]] in [[:en:New York|New York]] where he always dreamed of flying. In 1987 he graduated from the [[:en:United States Air Force Academy|United States Air Force Academy]] and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. He served as a [[:en:C-141|C-141]] pilot on active duty in the United States Air Force from 1988 to 1995 including flying during the [[:en:Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].  In 1999 he achieved the rank of major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.

He married Melodie on May 24, 1998 and their first child, Laurel, was born in late 2000.

On September 11, 2001, Homer was the co-pilot of United Airlines Flight 93. He was either killed or critically injured when stabbed by the hijackers. The hijacked plane later crashed after the passengers tried to regain control of the plane. It is unknown why but before the break-in Homer received a text message from the airport from his wife who wanted to make sure he was safe after the first two planes struck the WTC. He never answered the call.

Homer was posthumously awarded an honorary membership in the historic [[:en:Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee Airmen]].

He is survived by his wife, Melodie, daughter, Laurel, along with his mother, seven sisters, brother, and many other family members.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, September 11, 2001 at 9:50 AM, as a result of injuries sustained while operating at Manhattan Box 8087.

He was from Franklin Square, Long Island, New York. As a hobby, he enjoyed cooking, and is survived by his sister Jeanne, and his mother Christina Serafin.

He was born in Mineola, Long Island in 1965, and attended Public School 33 in Queens Village.

In 1983 he graduated from H. Frank Carey High School in Franklin Square at age 18. His yearbook photo was notable for his exceptional smile, and he was remembered by a classmate as being friendly, happy, and adventurous.

At age 21 he boxed in the Golden Gloves and was voted &quot;boxer of the night&quot; by the NY Daily News in 1986.

He joined the FDNY in 1994 at age 29, and in 2001 he was among six firefighters from Engine 33 who lost their lives in the terrorist attack of September 11th.

His memorial service was held at St. Catherine's of Sienna, a Catholic church on New Hyde Park road in Franklin Square.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Stuyvesant High School''' is located at 345 Chambers Street, a quarter-mile from [[en:World Trade Center site|the former site]] of the [[World Trade Center]]. The school was evacuated during the ordeal and the students were temporarily relocated to [[en:Brooklyn Technical High School|Brooklyn Tech]] starting September 21 while the Stuyvesant building was used as one of several bases of operations by rescue and recovery workers.  Normal classes resumed three weeks later on October 9.  

The following is a list of the Stuyvesant alumni who were killed during the [[September 11, 2001]] attack on the World Trade Center:

[[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] Lt. [[William McGinn|William &quot;Billy&quot; McGinn]] lost his life on duty in a North Tower staircase.  Posthumously promoted to Captain, Lt. McGinn was a member of a family based on Staten Island and strongly tied to Stuyvesant.  His father William McGinn taught at Stuyvesant for many years, and his brother Michael and cousin Connie both attended the school.  In the year following the attack, Michael's view of his brother was covered several times by the Times Herald-Record, a mid-Hudson valley newspaper (see [http://www.recordonline.com/archive/2001/10/10/omcolumn.htm], [http://www.recordonline.com/archive/2002/09/11/omcolumn.htm]).  Other sites on the web have also discussed Lt. McGinn's last morning (see [http://fallenbrothers.com/community/showthread.php?t=1015], [http://home.att.net/~t.deangelo/Our_Hero.htm]).

Stuyvesant alumnus [[en:Richard Ben-Veniste|Richard Ben-Veniste]] '60 was a member of the [[en:9/11 Commission|9/11 Commission]].

On October 2, 2001, the school paper, [http://spectator.stuy.edu/ ''The Spectator''], included a special full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections, and stories. The insert was reprinted in the Nov. 20, 2001 issue of the New York Times.

[[Image:With their eyes.jpg|right|thumb|90px|''With Their Eyes'']]

In the months after September 11, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant, a '93 alum, and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and after 9/11 and turn them into a series of monologues.  Thoms then published these monologues as ''With Their Eyes: September 11th &amp;#8211; The View from a High School at Ground Zero'' (ISBN 0060517182).  

Alexander Epstein of the Stuyvesant Standard, an independent school publication, contributed the section ''Out of the Blue'' to the book ''At Ground Zero: Young Reporters Who Were There Tell Their Stories'' (ISBN 1560254270).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] Lt. William &quot;Billy&quot; McGinn lost his life on duty in a North Tower staircase.  Posthumously promoted to Captain, Lt. McGinn was a member of a family based on Staten Island and strongly tied to [[Stuyvesant High School]].  In the year following the attack, his brother Michael's view of his life and death was covered several times by the Times Herald-Record, a mid-Hudson valley newspaper (see [[http://www.recordonline.com/archive/2001/10/10/omcolumn.htm]], [[http://www.recordonline.com/archive/2002/09/11/omcolumn.htm]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Fayez Banihamed''' (الله أَكْبَر) was a Muslim and a hijacker aboard [[United Airlines Flight 175]] on [[September 11, 2001]].

He grew up in the [[en:United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]] and left home in July, 2000. Before he arrived in [[en:Orlando, Florida|Orlando, Florida]] on June 27, 2001, Banihammad had opened a bank account in the UAE to which $30,000 was deposited by unknown parties only two days before his arrival. He opened another account with SunTrust Banks in Orlando several days after his arrival, becoming one of nine hijackers to open an account with the bank.

The [[en:9/11 Commission|9/11 Commission]] Report noted,  He appeared to have played a unique role among the muscle hijackers because of his work with one of the plot's financial facilitators, Mustafa al Hawsawi. On July 18, Banihammad gave Mustafa power-of-attorney over his Dubai bank account, and Mustafa reportedly mailed him a VISA and bank card.

A licensed pilot, he was registered as having trained at the Spartan Aeronautics School in Tulsa, Oklahoma - although the school denies that he ever attended.

He purchased both his and Mohand al-Shehri's one-way first class tickets for United Airlines Flight 175 online on August 27th or 29th, charging the $4464.50 to a Visa card from Mustafa al Hawsawi, listing their addresses both as a Mailboxes Etc. in Delray Beach. This was not the same postal box used by Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi who purchased their tickets for the same flight a day later with another Mailboxes Etc. postal box in Delray Beach, although both groups listed the same phone number.

Staying in the Milner Hotel in Boston from September 8-10, Banihammad asked a hotel clerk to fill out the registration card for the room, citing his poor English. 

On September 10, 2001, he was one of four hijackers (Marwan, Banihammad, sharing a room at the Milner Hotel).

It is supsected he was one of the two hijackers, the other being Mohand al-Shehri to started the hijacking on United 175.

==Aftermath==

After the attacks it was reported by [[en:ABC News|ABC News]] that somebody with the same name had attended the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base - a claim that may have been borne of a false address Banihammad had used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ray Downey''', 63, was killed when the North tower of the [[World Trade Center]] collapsed on [[September 11, 2001]]. A 40 year veteran of the [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]], he was chief of special operations command and the city's most decorated firefighter.                   

Newspaper accounts will generally sum up his career as &quot;Downey was an expert on urban search-and-rescue, and led a team of New York City firefighters who responded to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing&quot;. Which doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the contributions he has made to the fire service.

In [[en:1977|1977]] after attaining the rank of Captain, he was tapped to form a new squad company in Brooklyn. Squad 1 was the rebirth of the FDNY squad companies, and the resurection of a closed engine company (in a district that had enough political pull to get a closed engine company reopened). In 1980, he took over Brooklyn's Rescue company (FDNY Rescue 2). He led the tranformation of the company from the heavy fire duty &quot;war years&quot; of the 1970's to the modern Rescue Company. A rescue company (by Downey's own definition) combines firefighting with operations that involve extrication, search and rescue, hazardous-material response, scuba diving, and other specialized activities. In 1992 his book &quot;The Rescue Company&quot; was published, putting 30 years of knowledge and experience on paper where it now benefits the rest of the fire service.

As of 2005, 2,992 people were presumed dead as a result of all four September 11 attacks. This includes the casualties at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, on the airplanes and the hijackers.

== Planes ==

265 people killed on four planes; 232 passengers, 25 flight
attendants, 8 pilots.  (Note that this total includes the 19 hijackers, who reportedly boarded the planes as passengers.)

* [[American Airlines Flight 11|American Airlines flight 11]] BOS-LAX (north tower of [[World Trade Center]]): 93 people: 82 passengers (including 5 hijackers), 9 flight attendants, 2 pilots
* [[United Airlines Flight 175|United Airlines flight 175]] BOS-LAX (south tower of [[World Trade Center]]): 65 people: 56 passengers (including 5 hijackers), 7 flight attendants, 2 pilots

== World Trade Center ==
By 2004, 2602 people were listed as confirmed dead (this total excludes those aboard the two aircraft). 1585 victims were identifed from the World Trade Center wreckage while 1161 victims were not identifed when DNA testing ended in February 2005.

=== Missing Persons ===
The number of missing people grew to estimates as high as over 6000 in the weeks following the attack, but steadily declined as stories were checked and duplicate entries removed. 

As of August 2002, there were approximately 90 people who were officially missing; that is, their remains had not been identified and no family members had requested a death certificate.

=== Survivors ===

The great majority of the over 40,000 people working at the World Trade Center at the time of the attack evacuated safely, including 18 who escaped from above the impact zone in the second tower hit. By September 20, 2001, 6291 people, including rescue and recovery workers, had been treated for injuries.

== Pentagon ==

The Pentagon reports 125 staffers killed or missing, with 121 remains recovered and identified, as of September 11, 2002. At least one person died later as a result of wounds incurred. 

'''[[Casualties of the September 11, 2001 attacks: Pentagon|The listing and memorial]].'''

=== Missing Persons ===

The Pentagon reports 4 staffers missing. One passenger on the airliner which hit the Pentagon was also never identified.

=== Survivors ===

88 treated at hospital.

=== Victim legends ===

Due to the very large number of World Trade Center casualties and missing persons, '''victim legends''' were a common form of September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks urban legends. These were tales of victims who did not exist, spread by word-of-mouth and the Internet.  Official sites, such as http://www.september11victims.com, contain accurate entries and are trusted content.  Because Wikipedia, and many other websites allowed freely adding victims, there were no doubt many obvious fake entries.  Victims added to these lists were also sometimes simply missing at the time of the attacks, or actually survivors of the attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Matthew G. Leonard''' was director of litigation for [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities]].  He was a lifelong Brooklyn resident, devoted to his wife, Yolanda Cerda Leonard, and young daughter, Christina.  

Matt was a true renaissance man.  He could play a good game of basketball (but not dunk); cook a delicious three course italian meal and sing any musical or Christmas carol at the drop of a hat.

He was generous, compassionate, funny and, above all, a bringer of peace.  He is missed every day.

Maria was a beautiful young woman loved by all who knew her. She had just gotten engaged on August 11th, exactly a month before. I hurt so much when I actually sit down and think about that day, what must have been going through her mind, sometimes I still hear her calling me to help her. I miss her so much.
She had an infectious smile. People still come up to me and tell me stories about her and her smile. Thank you all for loving and respecting my darling Maria. God Bless You all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''David Charlebois''' (August 29, 1962 - September 11, 2001) was a pilot for [[en:American Airlines|American Airlines]].

He died at age 39 during the [[en:September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] as copilot of [[American Airlines Flight 77]].

He was survived by his life partner of 14 years, Tom Hay, and by his parents, who live in [[en:Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal, Virginia]]. He attended Catholic services with his parents until his death.

David helped carry the banner for the National Gay Pilots Association in the Millennium March on Washington in 2000, marching in uniform. After walking the parade route, he walked it again with the Gay and Lesbian Employees of American Airlines (GLEAM), saying that he wished to support the gay flight attendants who had supported him in coming out as a gay pilot. He also helped raise money for the Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League.

Paul Poux, son of a State Department official and a childhood friend since the seventh grade, recalls that Charlebois had a love of Paris since the two were children there together. &quot;He would say that when he was on his deathbed he didn't want to regret not making that last trip over there.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CeeCee Lyles''' was a flight attendant who died aboard [[United Airlines Flight 93]] in the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks.  She is best-known for calling her husband from the plane on a cellular telephone after the hijackers took control of the plane, a call that served as one of the few pieces of good evidence for what went on aboard the plane.

CeeCee Lyles phoned her husband in the last moments of her life to say goodbye. &quot;She called him and let him know how much she loved him and the boys&quot;, said her aunt, Mareya Schneider. 

Lyles lived in Fort Myers, Florida, with her family but stayed in a shared Newark, New Jersey, apartment when working for United Airlines. Lyles spent over six years as a police officer for the city of Fort Pierce, Florida.  She married her husband, who was also a police officer in Fort Pierce, in May 2000. In late 2000 she decided on a career change and started work as a reserve flight attendant.

She is survived by her husband, Lorne Lyles (31), and her sons Jerome Smith (16), Jevon Castrillo (6), Justin Lyles (11), and Jordan Lyles (9), along with her aunt Carrie Ross, who adopted CeeCee at the age of one week old, who raised her and called her a daughter, her aunt Mareya Schnieder, and other family.

In an interview shortly after the attacks Lorne said how he treasured this short conversation: &quot;Just hearing my wife saying she loved us through all that chaos on that plane is just embedded in my heart forever. That's my baby&quot;. 

He returned to work after half a year of mourning, but a month later, turning in his gun and badge, he resigned from the Fort Myers Police Department, citing personal reasons. 

In November, 2003, CeeCee Lyles was memorialized with a life-size statue (work of sculptor Chris Riccardo) at the Fort Pierce, Florida memorial for the heroes and dead of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''John B. Works''' always had his nose in a book. Or books - he usually had three or four going at a time, said his wife, Pamela Block Works. History books. Gold books. Economics books. Philosophy books. Historical fiction. (Dorothy Dunnett and Patrick O'Brian were favorites.) &quot;And lots of junk - `Star Trek,' &quot; she said. 

On his bedside table are &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; Neal Stephenson's novel about making and breaking codes, and Jack D. Schwager's &quot;New Market Wizards: Conversations with America's Top Traders.&quot; Mr. Works, 36, had recently become a trader himself; in March, he rejoined the investment firm of Keefe Bruyette, where he had started his career as an analyst. 

To house all those books, as well as their 3-year-old, Allison, the Workses were building a house on the site in Rowayton, Conn., where Mr. Works grew up. On weekends this summer, he would climb a ladder to the third floor, with its view of Long Island Sound. That floor was going to be his library, Mrs. Works said, &quot;with a large porch off it, because he always wanted a widow's walk.&quot;

He worked for [[Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.]] and died in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 during the terrorist attacks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alicia N. Titus''', 28, was born June 11, 1973 in Springfield, Oh. to John and Bev (Delaney) Titus of Dexter, Mich.

Alicia was greatly loved by family and friends. She enjoyed travel and experiencing world cultures. She loved life to the fullest and strived to make a difference in the world. Alicia embodied the spirit of peace and good will throughout her life. Alicia will be sadly missed by family and friends.

Titus was remembered at the service as a person &quot;who embraced peace and life,&quot; and her father, John Titus, read a poem he had written, describing his daughter as a &quot;soulful beauty, the embodiment of life.... Her greatest gifts were peace, love, joy, and life.&quot;

Titus, who earned an undergraduate degree in international marketing from Miami University, left her job as an account manager at Netcentives on Brannan Street last year, to become a flight attendant in hopes of traveling the world. She had been working as a flight attendant for only nine months when she and six other flight attendants, two pilots, and 56 passengers were killed aboard the flight that left Boston at 8:14 a.m. on Sept. 11 bound for Los Angeles.

&quot;I'm sure she found a way to make things easier for the passengers,&quot; her aunt Jody Lewis, who is a flight attendant for U.S. Airways, told the Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch. &quot;If she worked to calm or comfort or soothe just one person, that would have been okay for her.&quot;

&quot;She had a special kind of energy,&quot; Lewis also told the Dispatch. &quot;She was self-confident and used that to make sure that everyone around her felt better about themselves. You only had to meet her once to remember her.&quot;

Titus already had traveled to Paris, Hawaii, Morocco, and Spain, according to Lewis.

&quot;She was a thrill-seeker, an adventurer, who'd come face to face with a bear, looked into the eyes of a bull on the streets of Spain, and always wanted to harness the power to swim with wild dolphins in the ocean,&quot; her aunt said. &quot;One thing she never was, was afraid.&quot;

Titus' close friend Tamara Kley recalls that &quot;Alicia loved her neighborhood. One of her favorite places was the top of Bernal Heights, and she loved all the beautiful murals in the neighborhood and getting ice cream at Mitchell's.&quot;

The weekend before she lost her life, Titus and Kley spent time in Dolores Park. &quot;It was a beautiful weekend,&quot; says Kley. &quot;The sun was out, and we were singing on the swings, playing on the monkey bars.&quot;

Kley says that Titus had hoped to be a teacher one day and also to join the Peace Corps. &quot;There were so many things she wanted to do.&quot;

'''Jefrrey D. Bittner''' (January 7, 1974 - [[September 11, 2001]]) was from Wethersfield, CT. He was a 1992 graduate of the Kingswood-Oxford School in West Hartford, CT, and a 1996 graduate of Middlebury College in Middlebury, VT. He lived in New York City during adulthood.

Loyal and loving son and brother.  Best friend to countless lucky people, and inspiration to all who knew him.  He will be missed forever.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Michael John Simon''', age 40, was from Harrington Park, N.J. He was an energy broker at [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]]. 

My name is Chris Klass.  Michael was my brother in law.  He was married to my wife's sister Eileen.  Michael was a young, smart and loving man who valued his family over everything else.  I miss him today as I did on the day he died.  His death created a huge hole in all our lives.  Some days its so deep it swallows my heart whole.  I no longer believe that I or any of our family will every really learn to accept his death.  

Maybe that is the price of love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amy N. Jarrett''', 28, of North Smithfield, R.I., was a flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 175, the second plane to crash into the World Trade Center. Jarret had worked for United for the past six years after graduating from Villanova University. 

Aram Jarret loved everything about his daughter Amy's career as a flight attendant. 

&quot;She was the consummate professional,&quot; the 58-year-old North Smithfield, R.I. attorney said yesterday of his 28-year-old daughter, the third of his four children. &quot;She was smart, professional, very helpful, and she had no hesitation about putting someone in their place.&quot;

After the horror of the news that Amy was a flight attendant on United Airlines Flight 175 settled in, Aram Jarret also formed an image of what might have happened as terrorists seized control of the flight. 

&quot;If there's a crisis, then she would always be one of those people you'd want with you,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know what happened up there, but she would have been one of those people trying to do the right thing. 

&quot;But what strikes me is just how senseless this whole thing is, and it's tragic that innocent people get caught in this,&quot; said Jarret. &quot;She had no chance.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kathryn LaBorie''', 42, a flight attendant based out of Boston, worked only two routes: to Los Angeles and to San Francisco. 

LaBorie's parents had the television on when it happened. 

&quot;I tried to call on her cellphone. It was just silence,&quot; her father, Gene Yancey, said Monday. &quot;United called us fairly soon that day, 9:55 a.m. our time, but we knew.&quot; 

Those who knew LaBorie, a 1975 graduate of Mitchell High School in Colorado Springs, used nearly identical words to describe her. 

&quot;She was a vivacious young lady,&quot; said Adams County Commissioner Ted Strickland, who met her in 1986 when she worked on his gubernatorial campaign. 

&quot;She was just charming and vivacious and a lot of fun,&quot; said JoAnn Groff, president of the Colorado Retail Council. 

Survivors include her husband of two years, Eric, her parents and two brothers, Mark and Kevin. 

&quot;The theme is a celebration of Kathy's life,&quot; Yancey said. &quot;We're going to make it as uplifting as possible.&quot; 

Yancey, a retired Air Force officer, was stationed in Albuquerque when his daughter was born on March 14, 1957, a day after his wife celebrated her 22nd birthday. 

&quot;We always celebrated their birthdays together,&quot; Yancey said. 

LaBorie was raised in Colorado Springs. After high school she attended the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. She later won a scholarship to the University of Denver. 

LaBorie first joined Strickland's campaign as a volunteer, but later became a paid staffer, he said. It was during that time that she met Bill Schultz, the then-director of the retail council. The couple married and later divorced. 

&quot;A lot of people in Denver knew her through Bill,&quot; Groff said. &quot;I just can't describe how much fun she was.&quot; 

Strickland said that while flying to campaign stops, Laborie became friendly with the staff at Front Range Airport and went to work there. 

LaBorie had worked for United Airlines for nearly seven years. 

&quot;She loved to fly,&quot; her father said. &quot;There are no words to describe how we feel.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Michael C. Tarrou''', 38, was a flight attendant on Flight 175.

Tarrou grew up in Wantagh, N.Y., and [[Amy King|Amy R. King]] grew up in Jamestown, N.Y. Both moved to Stafford Springs where they met as flight attendants. 

He is survived by an 11-year-old daughter, Gina, from a previous marriage. Family members said he had a good relationship with his ex-wife, Jill, who recently moved to Florida with their daughter. &quot;He never intentionally hurt anyone,&quot; said his mother, Patricia Tarrou of Clearwater, Fla. 

Tarrou and King had hoped to move to Florida to be near his family. 

&quot;There is no doubt that both Mac and Amy would have done absolutely everything in their power to calm and protect the passengers and crew, and would have given their lives to prevent such a disaster,&quot; Tom Lumia, Tarrou's brother-in-law, said. &quot;They both were two of the most compassionate, peaceful, giving and understanding people on the earth, and they will be greatly missed. We will love them forever.&quot;

'''Michael Horrocks''' was serving as co-pilot on [[United Airlines Flight 175]] when he called his wife, Miriam, to say hello.

According to news reports confirmed by a family member, Horrocks called his wife before the plane took off and joked that the pilot--[[Victor Saracini]]--was &quot;some guy with a funny Italian name.&quot;

The 38-year-old native of suburban Philadelphia had two children, a son in 1st grade and a daughter in 4th. Miriam Horrocks is a gym teacher at a nearby grade school, the family member said. His plane crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center.

Horrocks was a retired Marine and was a quarterback at West Chester University in West Chester, Pa.

Later Bojan moved from the midwest to Connecticut, where he initially took a job painting houses, and then went on to Baruch College.

Following this he worked very successfully in finance, his last job being with [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities]]. He was a hard worker, getting into his office by 6 a.m. each day. He was single and lived on the West Side.

When he died, his sister, Nina, had also left Yugoslavia, living in London with her husband and daughter. She remembers her brother:

&quot;He was a kind and honest man. I had not lived in the same country as him for many years but we kept regularly in touch, both by phone and visiting each other. We were very close, and I miss him dreadfully.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hilda Marcin''' was born on December 11, 1921 in Schwedelbach, Germany. She moved to the United States in 1929 with her family and settled in Irvington, New Jersey. She married Edward in 1943 and had two daughters, Elizabeth and Carole. While living in Irvington, she worked for the Kearny, New Jersey shipyards during WWII where they built battle cruisers. Her husband worked for Kellogs, a defense factory, and later became an Irvington, New Jersey policeman. He died in 1979.

In 1984, Hilda moved from Irvington, New Jersey to Budd Lake, New Jersey. She then worked for the Mount Olive School System for 14 years and retired at age 79 in June 2001. She was a special education instructional aide at Tinc Road School.

On [[September 11, 2001]], Hilda was relocating to Danville, California to live the winter months with her daughter Carole and son-in-law Tom. She had planned to visit Elizabeth and her family the following spring.

Hilda is missed by her family. A close friend testified that &quot;she was a shining light who made everyone smile and gave of herself to others freely and generously. She was a hero to her family long before 9/11, and is now a hero to the world. God Bless her and the heroes of [[United Airlines Flight 93|United Flight 93]]&quot;.

Interviewed in the United Arab Emirates, Royal Highness Sheikh Abdulla bin Zayed said of al-Shehhi, &quot;He was a normal individual until he went to Germany. It seems when he went to Germany, he met these radical fanatics who have a very different understanding of Islam than we do.&quot;  In July 2000, he took flying lessons from Huffman Aviation. By December 2000, he receives a pilot license. By January 2001 he begins to train on a 727 simulator, which has controls similar to a Boeing 767.

==September 11, 2001==
Al-Shehhi is believed to be the hijacker who flew [[United Airlines Flight 175]] into the South Tower on [[September 11, 2001]].

While waiting before getting on a plane he got a call from Mohammed Atta telling him the attacks were ready to begin.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2002, as Patriot Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services and candlelight vigils. I also call upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Patriot Day. Further, I encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes on that day and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time, or another appropriate commemorative time, to honor the innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist attacks of [[September 11, 2001]].

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

'''Alan Patrick Linton, Jr.''' (1975 - [[September 11, 2001]]) Financial analyst for [[Sandler O'Neill and Partners]], an investment banking firm with offices on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's south tower. 

He phoned his mother, Sharon, after the first hijacked plane crashed into the north tower. &quot;He called to say he was fine,&quot; Sharon said. &quot;That was before anyone knew it was a terrorist attack. We just thought it was an accident.&quot; He became a casualty of the attacks when a second plane crashed into the south tower, which was the first to collapse. 

He was graduated from [[en:Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University]] in Pittsburg with a double major in industrial management and economics.  He traveled home to [[en:Frederick, Maryland|Frederick, Maryland]] almost every weekend. He is survived by his parents Sharon and Alan &quot;Pat&quot; Linton, a sister Laura Anspach and a brother Scott all of Frederick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Yudh V.S. Jain''', 54, New City, N.Y., was a senior project manager at eSpeed, [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]].

MEMORIES FROM FRIENDS:

&quot;Yudh was always polite and kept his cool no matter the controversy of the subject. His comments were well thought out and logically expressed. He had a way of injecting humor into the discussions so there was seldom any concern that we would get into any unfriendly arguments. Yudh was a gentleman, intelligent, firm in his convictions yet considerate of other people's opinions.&quot;


&quot;I worked with Yudh for 11 years at Simcon. He was a fine gentleman and a kind and loving person. He was also an excellent and an intellegent project manager. He was stolen from all of us on September 11th. &quot;


&quot;Reading tributes to Yudh in past tense is difficult because he is still so very much with us. With your tolerance, I will think of him in present tense. 

Soon after 9/11, I had this vivid dream - they had found bin Laden and I rushed to tell Yudh that they should cut him into 4,000 pieces, one for each victim. Yudh smiled as if gently scolding me. I woke up, instantly realizing how wrong I had been. Yudh is most kind, the gentlest of gentles. He would never kill anything or anyone, so why would he agree to such cruel thought? 

Because he is forgiving, he never has unkind words. Despite his brilliance, he is never brash. He lives simple life, works hard, yet touches us all with his gentleness. Too bad bin Laden never knows Yudh, otherwise he would have learned humanity and compassion. 

Last time I saw Yudh, it was two days before the WTC attack. As I said goodbye, he said that we would get together again. How I wish I could give him a big hug for that final farewell. My friend, keep your promise and meet me in my dreams.&quot;


&quot;We were privileged to have Yudh's friendship for over 30 years. He was the most gentle soul we have ever met in our lives. He set an example within our circle of friends for his compassion and ethics.&quot;


&quot;Over the years, I had the chance to work closely with him and learn to appreciate his vast knowledge and exceptional talent. I was also fortunate to be able to get to know him personally and to appreciate his good nature and kindness. We were good friends.
He was very proud for both of his daughters. We were all very shaken to learn about his fate at the WTC attack.&quot;


&quot;Good memories:
I worked with Yudh back in 1994. He was a manager of my last project with the company, soon after I left.
I was saddened and devastating by this news.
I will always remember him as a kind and caring person, soft voiced, respecting and helping people, who ever were working with him. Not many like him these days.&quot;


&quot;I just wanted to let you know that I am deeply saddened by the 9/11 events and especially about your Dad. I remember the first day he had the interview at eSpeed with one of the managers. After the intevew I walked him to the elevator and I told him good luck and that I hoped to see him again and his reply was, &quot;I hope so&quot;. A few weeks after he started working at eSpeed I was glad that he got the job. I told him if he needed any help or had any questions to ask me. Now I feel so sad that he is not with us anymore. I only knew Jain for about three months. He was a kind person and a gentleman - very soft spoken.&quot;


&quot;It is difficult to express in words the pain and sorrow we feel when we think of the tragic events of September 11th that took dear Yudh away from all of us.We can't even begin to imagine the anguish your family is experiencing from this unfortunate loss.We all knew Yudh when he worked for ABB and he touched us all with his grace and sincerity.To some of us he was a hard working co-workers, to some he was a mentor,but to all of us he was a friend, a dear friend ,kind and gentle human being who was always willing to help others.&quot;


&quot;I worked with Yudh for 6 years at Simcon and I always admired his knowledge and personal integrity.He will always be remembered fondly by those who knew him.&quot;


&quot;I was fortunate to have Yudh as my friend and mentor from the day I came to Lincoln, Nebraska for my graduate studies. Being in the same department and living close to Yudh's apartment, we shared several hours.

When Yudh moved to the New Jersey area, we were amongst the first to visit him from Lincoln, Nebraska. Yudh was always there to help me, as if I was his own brother, be it for a sight seeing trip or a job-hunting trip. Later on my family and I visited Yudh's family. Today I fondly remember all those occasions.

For all of us who knew Yudh, to say &quot;Yudh was a caring person&quot; would be an understatement. It is impossible for me put our sentiments into words. 

I am forever indebted to Yudh for his everlasting affection and unassuming, but nurturing, nature. His memories will be with me forever.&quot;


&quot;I consider it an honor to have met someone the caliber of Yudh. I enjoyed working with him and will miss him as do others from our group at ABB. Yudh was a true gentleman and an oustanding professional.&quot;



FROM FAMILY:

Sneh Jain (wife):
&quot; There are no words to express my admiration for my husband's great talents. He obtained his master's degree and doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln through a merit based fellowship that brought him here from India at the age of 18. He later obtained another PhD in computer science as well. I always used to tell him his first wife was his studies, not me. But still, despite his devotion to learning, he never tired of being a good father and provider and always treated me like a queen and his daughters like princesses. He lived for his family and his work and never for himself. He never complained about late hours or his many duties at home. Often, when I was angry with him for coming home late or having neglected some minor chore, he would simply smile and wait for the storm to pass with a smile on his upper lip. He is greatly loved by his co-workers, community and friends and he has touched all he has met with his gentle and quiet calm. Always there to lend a helping hand at any time of day or night, Yudh is a generous, unselfish and wonderful man who I will cherish forever in my heart. &quot;


Mona Jain (daughter): 
&quot;My father's greatest dream was his family and he, my mother, my sister and I like precious jewels. He was the perfect provider and lived for nothing else but to see us smile. I owe him everything I am and everything I will be and I want nothing more than to become the dreams he had for me. I love him dearly and he will be my guardian angel forever.&quot;


Cheena Jain (daughter): 
&quot;What can I say about my Dad. He could be remembered as a 9/11 victim. Sure. But there's so much more to remember him by. I'm sitting here writing this four and some days after he was taken from us. I can describe him so that people will know who he is one day. I write down memories of his all the time. I never want to forget him. But to characterize. My father was a rock. For me, specifically, he was person that, when I knew he was there, everything felt safe. Life would be okay. He even told me that life would be okay if something happened to him. As time would move on that I would go on. I think he said that to me when I was eleven. It's hard to describe. I was his baby girl and he was my everything. It's hard to express how hard things can become when I person leaves you and also how integral one person could be to your entire existence. Everyone has a couple of people like that, whether it's family members, best friends, mentors, etc. but for me, one of those people was my dad.

I remember after the attacks, I returned to college, still seventeen feeling like I was going on forty-five, and my 2D design professor asked me where I had been. He said something like: 'Where have you been? You haven't been around to make noise in my class; fighting a cold or something?&quot; I just said that my dad had died, in front of the whole class. He asked to see me after class. I remember we talked after class and I just poured myself out. The thing that resonates about that experience is that later on I did a project involving the loss of my father. It was a really horrific image that I had laid out, including a picture of my father holding me as a baby and my sister as a toddler hanging on to him. During my critique, my professor spoke about my work and mentioned the afternoon that I had sat and spoke with him so soon after the attack. He began to cry as he spoke about his talk with me and he said that when he thought about what I had said to him that afternoon, one thing was clear. He said 'I talked to her about her father for a while and it was so clear. Just from her words, the way she spoke about him, you could hear from her voice just how much he loved her.' That affection that my professor spoke of was not just for me, but for everyone he held dear.

To begin to comprehend who Yudh Jain was, there needs to be a comprehension of his pure and complete heart. So complete was his heart that it made mine feel whole. His love was his base. It was as though it radiated knowledge, experience, wisdom, compassion and of course all of his love. All of the love a father could give his daughters. All of the love a husband could give his wife. Pure compassion for the world. I could ask him any question and of course get a really long detailed response. If I cried, he couldn't stand to see it and he do anything to make me feel happy again. And he was my friend. I can't tell you all of the things we would say or do. There were many things. 

So now you understand. My father was my rock. Sometimes I wonder if I should run into the street and shout that I'm falling. But then the sun shines or there's a warm spring rain to run around or dance around in. I just tell myself that it's his way of taking away my tears and making me happy again. He always had a knack for that.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christopher Newton-Carter''' (December 16, 1949 - September 11, 2001) was killed at the [[World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001, aged 51.

He was associate director in charge of IT (information technology) at [[Sandler O'Neill and Partners]], which lost 67 employees that day. He lived in Middletown, New Jersey.

He was born in the UK, the elder son of Andre and Linda Newton-Carter. He attended Beaumont College (until its closure) and then transferred to Stonyhurst College, both of which were Jesuit schools.

He is survived by his mother, his wife (Susan), his sister (Teresa) and his brother, Mark, with whom he was on the phone for the last time.

[[Category:Sandler O'Neill victims|Newton-Carter, Christopher]]

Here is a eulogy from Chris' memorial service in the fall of 2001:

Chris Newton-Carter was a man rich in the values and blessings that good people everywhere strive to achieve. The most important thing in his life was his wife, Sue, who he cherished deeply. Chris expressed to me on many occasions the great happiness he had with Sue as his wife and partner. He also loved the home they shared and enjoyed being there with her more than anything else in his life.

Chris possessed tremendous love for his family and friends. By his nature, he was gentle, caring, and sensitive and he regularly combined this with his calmness and sense of humor to help family and friends with their issues and troubles. I know Chris would be here now, if he could be, telling us that things would be alright and not to be upset.

Chris was content with his life, he asked for very little and gave so much. At the office, Chris would arrive at about 7:15 in the morning. All Chris wanted was his 10 minutes to eat his breakfast in peace and then he would run non-stop for the next 9 to 12 hours. As a technologist, he held two jobs in running the firm’s computer systems, when a problem occurred he would first be a psychologist and calm down his tense co-workers with his lovable style, then he would change hats and fix the problem. Everyone in the office knew what a great person he was and liked working with him.      

Chris had two other great loves, for the United States and for his mother England. He retained the proper behavior of an English gentleman. He loved to travel back to England to visit family and friends and to just do some sightseeing. But his home, his heart, and his soul-mate were here now and he enjoyed being an American. Chris we will miss you dearly....


I would like to read a poem written by Chris’ friends Ian and Corrine MacRae who could not be with us today since they live in Perth, Australia:


Chris's mix of Italian and public school
Made his demeanor a blend of emotion and cool.
He was contented, reserved and easy to please,
But at the smallest excuse would erupt in laughter with ease.
A gift for outrageous understatement,
But with intense interest in what others would say.

Modest, self-effacing, a reliable friend,
One you would trust to the very end.
So happy in America, where opportunity beckoned,
With Sue, a soul mate, that's what he reckoned.
But he never left his friends and his family, they're close,
We knew he'd be there for us when it mattered.

I've checked all the photos I have in my file,
Each one is of Chris bearing an enormous smile.
They remind of the quips and wise cracks without end,
But to all of us we've lost the dearest of friends.
From many miles away, our hearts are with you,
We are sad, distraught... your loss is ours too.
 
John Faeth, a dear friend</text>

Rosie and I were never close, but I always admired him.  Rosie was a big guy, and when we played football, I was the only one who could tackle him.  He taught me how to swim past offensive linement, and how to party like a rock star.
It is hard for me to imagine him in a business suit staring out the WTC that morning.  I always remembered him as a party animal, living for the moment. 

Party hard, Rosie, party hard.

On September 11, 2001, shortly after the first plane struck Tower 1, Gschaar spoke to his wife, Myrta, over the phone and related that his building was fine, but that he was evacuating his team of 30 employees. &quot;I'll call you as soon as I can,&quot; he told her.

'''Patrick (Paddy) John Brown''' was born in Oak Park, Illinois on November 9, 1952. His father, John, was a FBI agent and his  mother, Ruth, a talented pianist who gave piano lessons while raising her family. An FBI transfer brought the family to Queens Village, New York in 1953 where Patty spent his childhood and where his brother, Michael, and his sister, Carolyn, were born.

Those who knew Paddy as a child recall that the fire department was always his passion. He’d spend as much time as he could at the local firehouse. He had a scanner in his bedroom and would respond to local fire calls on his bicycle. He watched the firefighters intently and absorbed the ways of the FDNY.

At 17 years of age Patrick became a US Marine. Persuading his father to sign a document allowing him a combat assignment, he went off to Vietnam. He became a highly respected and decorated Marine sergeant.

After his tour in Vietnam Paddy returned to New York, proud of his service to his country but also haunted by his memories of combat. He spent a number of years on the Fire Patrol as he settled in  Manhattan and on December 17, 1977 Patrick was appointed to the Fire Department of New York and so began what would become a legendary firefighting career.

As a firefighter Paddy was assigned to Ladder 26, Rescue 1 and Rescue 2. Promotion to a Lieutenant found him at Ladder 28 and as a Captain he served for many years at Engine 69. His final assignment was at the prestigious Ladder 3 on East 13th Street in Manhattan. 

While Paddy was making a name for himself in the fire department he was also busy otherwise. His passions extended beyond the walls of the firehouse. He was a Golden Gloves boxer and a second degree black belt in karate who donated his time to teach this martial art to the blind. As a member of the NYC Road Runner’s running club he ran in six marathons. He also attended John Jay College and earned a degree in Psychology.

Paddy never married but was never lacking for a Saturday night date to see the Broadway shows that he so loved. Handsome and very much a gentleman, he was actually at one time declared one of Manhattan’s most eligible bachelors.

Over his 24 years of service to the [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] Patrick became one of the department’s most decorated firefighters. He blended his extensive knowledge of firefighting with creativity, innovation, bravery and quick-thinking to perform spectacular and highly publicized rescues. For many of these he received FDNY medals. For his much publicized &quot;rope rescue&quot; which took place in May of 1991, Paddy received a letter of recognition from President George Bush. It always seemed that he was in the right place at the right time whether he was on or off duty (it was once said that when Pat walked down a street fire would break out spontaneously and young women would appear at their windows crying out to be saved.) Monetary rewards received along with these medals were always quietly donated by Paddy to the Burn Unit at Cornell University Medical Center.

Patrick was becoming recognized as one of the fire department’s living legends. As was said more than once, the only person that would object to this characterization would be Paddy himself. He was not comfortable talking about his heroic accomplishments. He preferred to be an outspoken advocate for improving conditions for his men. This trait sometimes got him in a bit of hot water with his superiors. But Paddy was not beyond ruffling some feathers to get what he knew his men needed and deserved. He developed a reputation of bravery, talent, and integrity and firefighters would request transfers to Paddy’s firehouse for the opportunity to work with and learn from him.

In the last ten years of his life Patrick found spirituality and comfort in the practice of yoga. Experiences in Vietnam and heartbreaking losses of some of his best friends in fire department line of duty deaths left him with feelings of deep pain and loss. (He once dedicated 40 days to taking care of his friend, FDNY Captain John Drennan, after he was severely burned in a fire. After John’s death Pat continued to be there to offer Captain Drennan’s family support and comfort.) In yoga Patrick found a way to focus his sadness and anger, acknowledge it and calm his mind and spirit. In yoga he found peace.

On September 11, 2001, Patrick and eleven men from Ladder 3 responded to the attacks at the World Trade Center. His firehouse, Ladder 3, is located in very close proximity to the Twin Towers so his was one of the first fire companies on the scene. Along with so many other rescue workers, the men of Ladder 3 participated in perhaps the most successful rescue effort in U.S. history. These rescue workers, at their own peril, managed to safely evacuate over 25,000 people from those burning towers. It is believed that Paddy and his men were on the 40th floor of the North Tower with 30 or 40 severely burned people when that tower fell.

Patrick’s life, soul, and spirit were remembered on what would have been his 49th birthday, November 9, 2001, at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. Thousands packed the enormous church to overflowing while firefighters lined up three and four deep as far as the eye could see on Fifth Avenue to honor and respect this legendary firefighter.

Pat’s remains were recovered from the rubble of the North Tower on December 14, 2001. On a cold, clear night two weeks later, according to Patty’s wishes, his ashes were spread by his family and friends in Central Park along a path where he loved to jog. Paddy’s body was put to rest but his spirit and influence lives on in the hearts and memories of all who knew him.

Since his death many people have shared personal stories of how Paddy helped and inspired them. He touched so many people’s lives. The honors for him continue even though he is no longer physically here with us. The Captain Patrick J. Brown Walk now runs along the East River on Avenue C in the shadow of the Stuyvesant Town apartment building he lived in. Also, a memorial scholarship fund has been set up in New Orleans in his name to help educate underprivileged children. A picture drawn by Canadian firefighter, Jim Nedelak is one of the most visible tributes to Paddy Brown. Mr. Nedelak used Pat’s likeness to represent firefighters everywhere and is a supreme honor.

Patrick Brown was passionate, intense, complicated, humble, and an inspiration to both those who knew him and those who are just now finding out about this incredible man. He’ll be remembered as a devoted friend, a dedicated firefighter, a warrior, and someone who made a difference.

Father '''Mychal F. Judge''', OFM, chaplain to the [[New York City Fire Department]], died Tuesday, September 11, 2001 in a hail of falling debris near the [[World Trade Center]].  He became the first officially recorded fatality following the attack.  Father Mychal was 68.

Born in Brooklyn, NY on May 11, 1933, Robert Emmett Judge was the son of two Irish immigrants from County Leitrim.  As a young boy, he watched his father die after a long illness.  To help his mother and two sisters make ends meet, he shined shoes in Manhattan, ran errands and did odd jobs, before being called to his Franciscan vocation at age 16.  He then entered St. Joseph’s Seraphic Seminary, Callicoon, NY, and graduated in 1954 after completing the first two years of college.

He was received into the Franciscan Order on August 12, 1954 and the following year, on August 13, professed his first vows of poverty, chastity and obedience as stated in the Rule of Life of St. Francis of Assisi.  He professed final vows on August 20, 1958.

He was ordained to the priesthood on February 25, 1961 at the Franciscan Monastery – Mt. St. Sepulchre, Washington, DC.  He spent a year of pastoral formation at St. Anthony Shrine, Boston, Mass., before his first assignment 1962-66 as an assistant at St. Joseph’s Church, East Rutherford, NJ.  He also served as an assistant at Sacred Heart Church, Rochelle Park, NJ from 1967-69.  In 1969 he came to St. Francis of Assisi Church, New York City, as local moderator for the Secular Franciscan fraternities.

In 1970, he returned to St. Joseph’s Church, East Rutherford, NJ, as coordinator of the parochial team ministry of Franciscan friars.  After six years, he was appointed in 1976 as assistant to the president at Siena College in Loudonville, NY, serving until 1979.  He then became pastor of St. Joseph’s Church in West Milford, NJ.  In 1985 he undertook a one-year theological sabbatical at the Franciscan house of studies in Canterbury, England.

Upon returning in the summer of 1986, he was appointed an associate pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Church, New York City.  At the friary there, finding many “Michaels” on the staff, he decided to change the spelling of his name to Mychal.  Only a few days after arriving at St. Francis, he responded to a call to celebrate Mass in the hospital room of New York police officer Steven McDonald, who had been critically wounded during an investigation of a youth in Central Park.  Father Mychal and the McDonald family soon became devoted friends.  Among their good-will travels, Father Mychal accompanied Detective McDonald on visits to Northern Ireland in 1998, 1999 and 2000 to encourage reconciliation.

In 1992, upon the death of Fr. Julian Deeken, OFM, a Franciscan friar who had served as one of the Catholic chaplains for the New York Fire Department, Father Mychal accepted an invitation to serve temporarily in his place.  Fr. Mychal was named chaplain officially in 1994 to serve the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island.

[[Image:Mychaldeath_sm.jpg|thumb|right]]

When TWA Flight 800 exploded shortly after takeoff from New York in July 1996 and fell into the Atlantic off Long Island, Father Mychal helped counsel the families and friends of the victims every day for three weeks and worked to arrange a permanent memorial at the site.  He had since returned every summer to offer a memorial service and comfort the families.

Over the years, Father Mychal won the hearts of the firefighters and their families by his charismatic Irish personality and warm Franciscan outreach to them in all their needs – baptisms, weddings, funerals, hospital visits – wherever and whenever he was sought.  He was also active in a diverse ministry to various groups throughout the Metropolitan area.

More than 2,800 people attended the Mass of Christian Burial for Father Mychal on Saturday, September 15 at St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan.  Father Mychal was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa, NJ.  He is survived by two sisters, Erin McTernan and Dympna Jessich.

He died at age 38 in the [[September 11, 2001]] terrorist attack at the Pentagon.

He was the Deputy Current Operations and Plans Branch Head for the Chief of Naval Operations, although at the time of the attack, he was helping to coordinate defence efforts. He had only been promoted to Commander that August, the highest rank anyone in his family had achieved. His father and two brothers also served in the Navy, with a combined 72 years of service. 

Although I never knew him personally, others describe him as witty and intelligent. I haven't seen a picture of him without a huge grin, as though he's planning on either pulling a practical joke on you or he's going to try to make you laugh. When his brother was out to sea and he was back at the base, he'd go and visit; I can imagine him playing video games with his nephew, dolls with his niece, and helping his sister-in-law clean up. He had saved his boutonniere from his wedding. I think I would've liked him -S.B.

He served on the USS Spartanburg County, where he served as a combat information center officer, electronic material officer and gunnery officer; the USS Harry E. Yarnell as damage control assistant; at Fleet Combat Training Center Atlanta as a cruise missile instructor; on the USS Scott as an engineer officer on department head tour; then was assigned to the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet staff, as the officer in charge of the Tomahawk Afloat Planning System and the Tomahawk action officer for the Director of Operations, Plans and Policy; and was Executive Officer on the USS Radford (otherwise known as the ship that's giving everyone the finger) until he was assigned to the Pentagon. 

At his Alma Mater, Washington and Lee University, there's the Schlegel Prize for International Studies in his honor; his name is on memorial plaques at the Naval War College in Newark, Rhode Island, and at Old Dominion College, where he graduated from Officer Training School and got his Master's Degree in International Affairs, respectively. There is also a monument at Gray-New Gloucester (G-NG) High School, where he graduated in 1981.  

He was survived by his wife, Dr. Dawn Schlegel, two children, his parents, two brothers, a couple of nieces, and a newphew.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mark Whitford''' was a firefighter in the [[New York City Fire Department]]. He was a three-time city wrestling champion, but his best firefighting save had less to do with brawn and more to do with quick thinking and compassion.

One night as he sat on duty in a fire truck, a couple approached him. The wife was in labor and they could not reach the hospital in time. He adapted his basic EMT training to deliver the baby in the couple's car, his brother, Dennis, said.

Whitford, 31, was a firefighter for three years with Engine Co. 23 in midtown Manhattan. He has been missing since responding to the World Trade Center attack.

Born and raised in Staten Island, Whitford graduated from Tottenville High School in 1989. From 1987 to 1989, he was the PSAL wrestling champion in his weight class. At Seton Hall University, where he graduated in 1993, he was the eastern regional wrestling champion in 1992 and 1993, and a two-time NCAA qualifier.

In high school, when Mark was a sophomore and Dennis a freshman in 1987, Dennis was also PSAL wrestling champion in a different weight class. &quot;We were almost like twins together,&quot; said Dennis Whitford, of Sayville, N.J.

With his wife, Renee, Mark Whitford had twins of his own -13-month-old Matthew and Timothy. A year ago, the family moved from Staten Island to Washingtonville.

Another brother, Chris, of Rock Tavern, is a policeman with the First Precinct assisting in the rescue operation. Mark Whitford is also survived by a sister, Lisa Walker of Oldbridge, N.J., and his parents, Roger and Carol, of Staten Island.

      <text xml:space="preserve">James Berger, 44 years old, worked as a Senior Vice President at [[Aon Corporation]], an insurance firm that employed 1,100 people in the south tower.  

After the first jet hit the north tower he could have made the easy decision to leave while there was still time, but he stayed behind to coordinate his company’s evacuation.  His unselfish sense of duty was apparent when a crowd of evacuees tried to drag him into an elevator.  He firmly stated, “No.  I’m going back”.  James Berger was killed when the south tower collapsed.  Thanks to his efforts only 175 out of 1,100 Aon employees perished in the attacks.

He left behind his wife Suzanne and three children; Nicholas, Alex and Christian.

== Bruce Springsteen Honors 9/11 Victims ==

Bruce Springsteen read James Berger’s obituary in the NY Times and saw that it mentioned how much James loved his music.  That inspired Bruce to give his widow, Suzanne Berger, a phone call to offer his condolences.  

Bruce also created a specially made video of “Thunder Road”, which was Jim’s favorite song.  It was dedicated to the Berger family and was played at the memorial service.  The next year Bruce penned a song called, “You’re Missing” to honor the Bergers.

Bruce stirred a bit of controversy by dedicating a whole album to the victims of the 9/11 attacks.  He was accused of profiting from their suffering.  

The Berger family and many other families strongly objected to these accusations.  His actions were greatly appreciated by Suzanne Berger.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On [[September 11, 2001]] '''Martin John Coughlan''', 54, of County Tipperary, Ireland, a carpenter, died. He was just one of the 2,996 victims of the coordinated terrorist attacks against the United States. Below are some of the articles written about this father of four daughters, Orla, Ailish, Sinead and Denise, and beloved husband of Catherine Coughlan.

&quot;'''The Carpenter From Cappawhite'''

He was born in the shade of the Galtees,

From the village of Cappawhite he did hail,

But after September the eleventh,

No more would he return to his Golden vale.

He died on top of the world,

With his hammer in his hand,

And he broke the hearts of so many

Back home in his native land.

So goodbye Martin John Coughlan,

With that smile all loving and true,

Sleep now with the angles in heaven,

Goodbye my friend, and god bless you.

'''''anonymous (Friend) 09 Oct 2002 Age: 53 Occupation: Carpenter Worked for: Originally from: Cappawhite, Co Tipperary Resided in: Queens, NY - Martin's brother Finbar,'''''&quot;

----

How can I make this person I never knew real to you? Maybe this will do it. From the Irish tribute pages:

&quot;Martin John Coughlan was my father. 

But, he wasn't just my father because 

I just so happened to be born. 

He was my father because

he... cared about me. 

raised me. 

Loved me. 

Picked me up from dance class never being a second late. 

encouraged me. 

Gave me someone to look up to. 

Made me laugh. 

Gave me everything I ever needed, even when I didn't deserve it. 

taught me.

He was the best father anyone could ever have. 

There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about you Dad. We all miss you! 


-- '''''Denise Coughlan (Daughter {}) 20 Oct 2002'''''&quot;

Victims. Two thousand nine hundred and ninty nine is the official count of the deaths caused by the first serious terrorist attacks in our own country in many years. 

The number is too limited. While only that many died, many more had their lives destroyed that day. For my man, Martin, there were five in his immediate family that had their hearts broken. &quot;They tried the hospitals yesterday looking for Martin but it looks bleak&quot;. The hope that they would find their father and the prayers that Catherine must have prayed as they searched for him, wilting as they realized he was not among the wounded, dying as they faced the fact that their man would never be home again. 

How I hurt then as a caring bystander. Having lost the mate, I hurt as a fellow mother and wife. Earlier I lost my father and now I can understand the pain and saddness of the daughters. My children and I know how the sudden and unexpected death of the man of the family can not only hurt your heart but change your everyday life in ways you can't foresee. Every one of the victims of 9/11 devastated a family and friends. I can not imagine the tsunami of ripples in the life of the city and nation this attack cause. 

Martin was the same generation as my mate and I. A peer. If we had met we might have been friends. The tributes for him and the one photo I have found show a smiling man with kind eyes. He loved and was loved by his family and friends. He was a comic and and singer at parties he attended. He was Irish and I imagine him with a thick brogue rolling through &quot;Danny Boy&quot; with friends, toasting his wife over a glass of champagne, laying his arm over the shoulder of a daughter and smiling at her. I ache for them.

The total number of people who were personally affected by the murders committed on 9/11 is unknowable. The trickle effect has spread the pain of the loss of these people to many of us that never knew them. We must make sure the people responsible are punished. 

We do not forget.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Francisco_cruz.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco Cruz (1954-2001), &quot;The Quiet Guitar Player&quot;]]

'''Francisco Cruz, Sr.''' was a security guard for Summit Security at the [[World Trade Center]]. He was last seen guiding firefighters through 5 World Trade Center.

&quot;He was a good man,&quot; said his wife, Carmen Candelaria, who uses her family name. &quot;I loved him so much.&quot;

The couple had been together for 21 years, she said, and Mr. Cruz was especially caring and sensitive during her occasional bouts with asthma.

&quot;He helped me very much. When I was sick, he would go to the doctor with me or take me to the hospital,&quot; she said. &quot;He was very special in my life.&quot;

Francisco Cruz was not much for words — the kind of guy who would go to a party, look over the dance floor and head straight for a dark, quiet corner. When Mr. Cruz, a security guard for Summit Security in the World Trade Center, did have something to say, he let his guitar speak for him, spewing out fiery renditions of tunes by Jimi Hendrix, Carlos Santana and Jose Feliciano. &quot;Music was his life,&quot; said his brother Tomas Cruz. &quot;It allowed him to escape outside of himself. He would just come alive.&quot;

Music hooked Mr. Cruz, 47, at an early age. While kids all around him were busy dreaming baseball, Mr. Cruz became mesmerized by a neighborhood kid who was learning to play the guitar, and earning lots of attention because of it. Young Mr. Cruz wanted to be cool, too. &quot;But we didn't have a guitar, and our mother didn't have the money to buy one,&quot; his brother recalled. &quot;So we would steal my uncle's guitar and hang out in the hallway with it, like we knew what we were doing.&quot;

Soon, Mr. Cruz had taught himself and his younger brother how to play. &quot;I'll never be half as good as he was,&quot; Tomas Cruz said, &quot;but when I'm playing, it keeps me with him and takes me back to our good times.&quot;

Querido Frankie,

Aun recuerdo que en la madrugada del 11 de Septiembre 2001 tu no querias ir a trabajar,pero tenias que hacerlo.Mas tarde recibi tu llamada donde me desias que no sabias lo que estaba pasando afuera
Me acuerdo que te grite &quot;Frankie salte del building&quot; y tu me contestaste que no podias por que tenias que ayudar a los demas.Esa fue la ultima vez que escuche tu voz y se escuchaba el miedo que tu tenias.Nunca pense que me ivas a dejar y mucho menos de esa manera.Francho hace casi un ano que te fuistes de mi lado pero aun el dolor de haberte perdido se siente igual.Yo se que tu estas con el Senor y que estas descansando en paz pero, quiero que sepas que aun te extrano mucho.Tu eras mi esposo,mi amigo y mi companero.La persona con quien comparti mi vida por 22 anos.El hombre a quien yo quise,quiero y voy a querer toda la vida.Vivir sin ti no sera facil pero yo tratare de seguir adelante como tu lo hubieras querido.Te extrano mucho tu esposa y amiga Carmen.

Que descanses en paz y nos veremos algun dia.I Love You Francho.

''Translation:

My dear Frankie,

Once memory from the dawn of September 11, 2001 is that you didn't want to go to work, but you had to do so. A little later, I received your call where you told me that you didn't know what was going on outside. I remember that I yelled &quot;Frankie get out of the building!&quot; and you answered me that you couldn't because you had to help the others. That was the last time I heard your voice and I heard the fear that you had. I never thought that you would leave me and even less in this way. Frankie it's been almost a year since you left my side but the pain of losing you still feels the same. I know that you are with God and that you are resting in peace, but I want you to know that I miss you terribly. You are my husband, my friend, my companion. The person with whom I shared my life for 22 years. The man that I wanted, that I want, and that I will always want for my whole life. Living without you will not be easy but I will try to continue forward like you would have wanted. I miss you very much, your wife and friend, Carmen

You should rest in peace and we'll see each other again another day. I love you Francho

Francisco Cruz was a security guard and an avid guitarist. He passed on a chance to work for higher pay at another building because 'he loved the World Trade Center'

Francisco Cruz wasn't much of a talker.

Soft-spoken and shy, the West Brighton resident would retreat into a quiet corner at parties and social gatherings. But put a guitar or bass in his hands, and Mr. Cruz would come alive.

From volcanic rock 'n' roll riffs to pulsating salsa beats, Mr. Cruz let his music do the talking.

&quot;Music was an outlet for him to express himself,&quot; said Zulma Cruz, his sister-in-law. &quot;He had a passion for music.&quot;

A security guard for Summit Security at the World Trade Center, '''he was last seen, Ms. Cruz said, guiding firefighters through 5 World Trade Center.'''

&quot;He was a good man,&quot; said his wife, Carmen Candelaria, who uses her family name. &quot;I loved him so much.&quot;

The couple had been together for 21 years, she said, and Mr. Cruz was especially caring and sensitive during her occasional bouts with asthma.

&quot;He helped me very much. When I was sick, he would go to the doctor with me or take me to the hospital,&quot; she said. &quot;He was very special in my life.&quot;

Although Mr. Cruz was a relative newcomer here -- moving to West Brighton four years ago -- the Island long held a special place in his heart. The serene waters at Clove Lakes Park reminded him of his native Puerto Rico, said Ms. Cruz, and he gravitated there on visits to her West Brighton home.

&quot;His dream was to have a house on Staten Island,&quot; said his wife.

He played in rock and Latin bands for a quarter of a century. When he wasn't jamming in small Brooklyn clubs with his brother, Tomas, he was entertaining relatives at family affairs, Ms. Cruz said.

Jimi Hendrix, the left-handed rock guitar legend, was among her brother-in-law's biggest influences, said Ms. Cruz.

And just as Hendrix's high-voltage solos and lyrical phrasing fanned Mr. Cruz's musical zeal, he attempted to instill the same love of music in his three nieces, five nephews and stepgrandchildren.

&quot;Every Christmas they would get something related to music -- a little guitar or keyboard, headphones or CDs,&quot; said Ms. Cruz, who has one of her brother-in-law's original guitars. &quot;The kids loved it.&quot;

Mr. Cruz took the youngsters under his wing, helping them learn their instruments. Her daughter, Candice, 16, always sought his assistance before taking a music test in school, Ms. Cruz said.

Born in Puerto Rico, Mr. Cruz moved to Brooklyn in the early 1960s. He graduated from John Jay High School in Brooklyn, and from Kingsborough Community College, also in that borough, with a music degree.

But in 1983, he and his wife wanted to &quot;try another life&quot; and moved back to Puerto Rico, Ms. Candelaria said. The experiment lasted just 18 months before the couple returned to Brooklyn.

&quot;He loved New York too much,&quot; she laughed. &quot;He loved Brooklyn.&quot; They settled in West Brighton in 1997.

Mr. Cruz was employed by several security companies in Manhattan before joining Summit Security 13 years ago.

He worked in Tower 2 and his affection for the Twin Towers tragically became his undoing. Less than a year ago, Mr. Cruz had passed on an opportunity to work for higher pay at another Manhattan building.

&quot;He loved the World Trade Center,&quot; Ms. Cruz said.

On the day of the attack, Mr. Cruz was sent to 5 World Trade Center after the second hijacked plane slammed into Tower 2. He and a team of security guards were escorting firefighters through the structure to aid the evacuation.

&quot;The security guards knew the ins and outs of the building,&quot; said Ms. Cruz. During the evacuation, Mr. Cruz telephoned his office manager, who was on a below-ground level of Tower 2, and instructed those still in the office to leave the building before it collapsed, Ms. Cruz said.

Mr. Cruz relished nature as much as he did working at the Twin Towers and playing guitar. The majestic trees and serene pastoral nooks drew him to Clove Lakes Park, where he combined his ardor for the outdoors and music. Guitar in hand, Mr. Cruz would sit by the lake for hours, composing and arranging music. Mr. Cruz also enjoyed visiting Our Lady of Mount Carmel-St. Benedicta R.C. Church in West Brighton.

In addition to his wife, Carmen, and his brother, Tomas, surviving are his son, Francisco Jr.; his mother, Juliana Velasquez; his sister, Iris Cutillo, and five stepgrandchildren.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Growing up in Atlanta, '''Adam White''' was like an electron zinging through an always-interesting orbit, or maybe several orbits at once. &quot;He was an exhausting child,&quot; said his stepmother, Georgia, who joined the family when Adam was 4. And also a charming one, who packed more into his waking hours than anyone she knew.

He loved surprises and drama and being the star of the show. When his high school put on a production of &quot;Amadeus,&quot; he landed the role of Mozart, playing all the piano passages himself. He had hundreds of friends, scattered all over the world, and dozens of interests, like mountain climbing and traveling and oratory, into which he poured his heart.

Adult life took him to San Francisco, and then to New York, where Mr. White, 26, was developing an electronic trading program in carbon dioxide for [[Cantor Fitzgerald Securities|Cantor Fitzgerald]]. &quot;The bigger the city, the better for him,&quot; Mrs. White said. &quot;His brothers used to go and visit him, wherever he was, and say afterwards that they felt like they had been there for a month when it had only been a few days.

&quot;His dad went up to visit him in New York for a weekend last year, and when he got back he had to rest for a couple of days before he could go back to work. Everything was so exciting with Adam.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eric Allen''' was born January 7, 1957.

He graduated Brooklyn's Nazareth Regional High School in June 1975. During his high school years, Eric was on the swim team as a sophomore, ran track all four years, and played french horn in the school band.

While in high school, Eric lived with his grandfather above the grandfather’s hardware store at 213 Schenectady Avenue in Brooklyn.

Eric eventually settled in Brooklyn’s Bay Ridge neighborhood.

In the [[New York City Fire Department]] (FDNY), Eric held the rank of Firefighter.

His last assignment was at Squad 18 located at 132 West 10th St, New York, NY 10019. This is quoted from FDNY Squad 18’s website:

''&quot;Eric Allen came from Engine 217 Bed-Stuy Brooklyn via Squad 288 in Queens. He never lost his true roots as an Engine man. Small in stature, huge in heart .&quot;Stay low and go.&quot; He had no choice with staying low, but go he did. Eric was our resident Jack-of-All-Trades. The beginning and end of each tour, Eric would carry all of his 5 gallon buckets in and out of the Firehouse on West 10th Street. We kidded him that he had broad shoulders due to this personal exercise program of his. He was never happier than when he was talking about his wife Kiki, and the birth of their daughter three years ago. Always helping out someone no matter what needed to be done, Eric was a true friend to all.&quot;
- Bob Stude, FDNY Ret., Squad 18'' [http://www.fdnysquad18.com/memorial.php]

A street renaming for Eric was held on Friday, October 22, 2004 at 71st Street and Ridge Avenue, Brooklyn.

Eric is survived by his wife Kiki (Angelica) and their daughter Kathleen.

Eric was laid to rest on September 20, 2001. At the time of his death, he was 44 years old.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''World Trade Center''' was a complex of large office buildings in southwestern New York City which occupied an irregularly shaped block bounded by Vesey Street, Church Street, Liberty Street, and the West Side Highway. The 110-storied Twin Towers impacted by [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]] were only two of seven numbered buildings comprising the Center; the collapse of the Twin Towers due to melting of their iron trusses by burning jet fuel also destroyed several other buildings nearby.
