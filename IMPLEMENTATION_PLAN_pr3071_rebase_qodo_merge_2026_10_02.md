# PR3071 Latest Dev Rebase, Qodo Review, and Merge

Task: TASK-13421.1. PR: https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw_server/pull/3071.

Goal: Rebase the existing PR, resolve verified review/CI findings, and merge only
the qualified final head. Preserve the requester-authored Change summary.

ADR check: No new ADR required; integration and corrective review work do not
change a durable architecture rule. ADR-002, ADR-004, and ADR-006 govern tracking,
human ownership, and security verification.

## Stage 1: Preserve and Rebase
**Goal**: Rebase on fetched dev8140e493f2d0a79e2039084930151eba6565df82,
including its AuthNZ/resource-governor advancement from the earlier 38b baseline.
**Success Criteria**: Backup ref retained; complete result equals expected clean
integration tree cbf4388b66855d5d255b784b87ae3dae28c04061, except this task/plan.
The final reviewed-fix rebase produced HEAD0ac9032 with expected integration tree
05f818713d3d59ff7c48e8d2762c24d14a180523; all upstream AuthNZ/RG paths match dev.
**Tests**: Git ancestry/tree comparison; original stash inventory unchanged.
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 2: Verify and Publish
**Goal**: Verify the rebased implementation and resolve published-ADR drift.
**Success Criteria**: Docs refresh and affected owning regressions pass; normal
hooks pass; publish using a lease bound to original head 0c9d592231dfee52642ce970f9f8cf159ebdfd49.
**Tests**: Docs refresh suite, changed CI/test-isolation regressions, owning Chat
Workspace regressions, touched-scope Bandit, and exact production-source binding
to prior real Chrome desktop/mobile acceptance. Unit doubles are not UAT.
**Status**: Complete

Verified: docs33; combined owning273; incoming fixtures52; Chat180passed/24skipped;
CI helper/workflow56 and formatted helper5. Independent review's child-PATH
lookup defect is fixed with a red/green regression; no runtime changes. Dev
advanced to38b09af8e92b3d9a2a00aced22d6b992dbae9435 with only relay task metadata;
include that final delta before publishing. Retain initial path-guard test
invocation failures and raw Bandit test-assert diagnostics in the evidence.
The final rebase completes cleanly and matches expected treea082f5f9. Every
applicable configured pre-commit check passes. Published head5860186188 is
verified OPEN and ready with the exact prepared body and unchanged human summary.

## Stage 3: Qodo and CI
**Goal**: Mark ready, evaluate every PR finding, and qualify the final head.
**Success Criteria**: Each actionable finding fixed with regression coverage or
answered with verified evidence; no unresolved blocking finding; exact-head CI
successful. Do not interpret missing Qodo review as approval.
**Tests**: Per-fix red/green tests, security checks, final GitHub checks/threads.
**Status**: In Progress

Qodo completed review in comment5958856767: eight findings and nine inline
comments. Bounded fixes cover absent-snapshot activation, canonical preview
identity (including null URL), SSE control-frame forwarding, streamed error
propagation through the existing parser, and schema-helper types/docs/unit marker.
Frontend transport70, activation278 (independent review290), preview53, backend
175, scope/marker17 pass. Typecheck, ESLint, Python lint/format and runtime Bandit
pass; inherited Node/i18n/test warnings remain recorded, not suppressed.
The current Chatbook client lacks diagnostics scope arguments; the server's
explicit owner/scope checks remain intact. Companion-repository approval is
pending; do not call this compatibility gap fixed.
Dev advanced during review to8140e493f2d0a79e2039084930151eba6565df82 with
AuthNZ/resource-governor changes. Integrate and qualify that actual backend base
before publication. The new frontend build/token/budget checks pass; preliminary
38b backend availability is not UAT of8140. Final no-mock Chrome UAT, Qodo
disposition and exact final-head hosted CI remain required before merge.

Fresh rebased8140 owning/incoming regressions266pass. Live Chrome proved one
retrieval without generation and one verified Gemma input/result pair, but dropped
heartbeats; that failed acceptance is retained, not called passing. Config enables
the unified transport, which re-filtered pipeline-generated heartbeats. The minimal
existing-queue preservation fix has expected RED then GREEN3; full owning507pass,
1skip, runtime Bandit0. Independent scoped review found no actionable regression.
Do not resend the completed original turn.

Final independent review found three further bounded recovery defects, tracked as
TASK-13421.1.5/.6/.7: suppress unsupported selected-durable legacy regeneration,
preserve prepared recovery text exactly once, and provide router-aware manager
navigation after failed activation. Tests100/97/101 pass respectively; docs33pass.
F1/F2 scoped independent reviews pass. F3's raw-link extension defect was
confirmed RED through real hash/memory navigation and corrected with existing Link.
Frontend TypeScript8GB passes; the initial default-heap OOM is retained. Actual
ESLint analyzes all touched shared files with zero errors and11 inherited ChatPane
warnings; out-of-base ignored-file invocation is not lint qualification. Expanded
upstream Bandit retains19 low token-type literals in files byte-identical to dev,
not new findings or a zero-findings expanded scan. Final production build/source
binding and native desktop/mobile acceptance remain under qualification.

## Stage 4: Merge and Read Back
**Goal**: Merge the verified PR into dev without bypassing checks.
**Success Criteria**: Human summary byte-identical, latest head/base rechecked,
GitHub reports MERGED and its merge commit is verified on dev; task finalized.
**Tests**: Fresh PR/review/check readback and GitHub merge outcome. Preserve live
services, profiles, tabs, drafts, databases, unrelated files, and backup refs.
**Status**: Not Started
