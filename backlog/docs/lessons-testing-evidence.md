# Testing Evidence Lessons

## Generic dict lint rules do not apply to `sqlite3.Row`

**Incident (TASK-13144, 2026-08-30):** Ruff's `SIM118` suggestion replaced
`for key in row.keys()` with `for key in row` in `PersonalizationDB`. The new
Personal Context tests stayed green, but the combined existing Personalization
regression run produced eight `IndexError` failures because iterating a
`sqlite3.Row` yields values rather than column names.

**Evidence and rule:** Restoring `.keys()` with a narrow lint exemption returned
the same 53-test combined run to green. Do not apply dict-iteration
simplifications to `sqlite3.Row`; when a shared database wrapper changes, pair
new-feature tests with its existing consumer suite.
