# Testing Evidence Lessons

## Generic dict lint rules do not apply to `sqlite3.Row`

**Incident (TASK-13144, 2026-08-30):** Ruff's `SIM118` suggestion replaced
`for key in row.keys()` with `for key in row` in `PersonalizationDB`. The new
Personal Context tests stayed green, but the combined existing Personalization
regression run produced eight `IndexError` failures because iterating a
`sqlite3.Row` yields values rather than column names.

**Evidence and rule:** Restoring `.keys()` with a narrow lint exemption returned
the same 53-test combined run to green. Do not apply dict-iteration
simplifications to `sqlite3.Row`; when a shared database wrapper changes, pair
new-feature tests with its existing consumer suite.

## Lifecycle fences must be proven inside the write transaction

**Incident (TASK-13145, 2026-08-30):** The Personal Context service checked the
purge-pending state before proposal and runtime writes, and its sequential tests
passed. Independent review showed a purge could commit after that check but
before either standalone repository transaction, allowing the later write to
recreate encrypted state beyond the purge barrier.

**Evidence and rule:** Passing the expected manifest version into each write and
rechecking both the manifest head and surviving scope state under the same
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction closed the race; targeted purge-race regressions
then passed. For destructive lifecycle barriers, a service precheck is UX only:
the storage transaction must enforce the same fence.

## Exercise canonical factories, not only service fakes

**Incident (TASK-13148, 2026-08-30):** Personal Context bootstrap unit tests
passed with service fakes, but the first authenticated endpoint test using the
real factory failed with `personal_context_snapshot_unavailable`. The canonical
profile clock emitted arbitrary microseconds while canonical serialization
permits millisecond precision only, so a fresh profile could not be snapshotted.

**Evidence and rule:** Normalizing the service clock at the canonical mutation
boundary made the real authenticated bootstrap, stale-completion, receipt, and
post-link push flow pass. When a feature composes storage, canonical models, and
HTTP dependencies, include at least one test through the production factory;
service fakes cannot prove cross-layer serialization contracts.
