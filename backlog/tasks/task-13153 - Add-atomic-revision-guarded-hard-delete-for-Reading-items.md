## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a positive, monotonically increasing integer `revision` to persisted Reading items and every
Reading summary/detail response. Every item-owned mutation that can change the user's deletion
decision increments that revision, including metadata/status/tag changes and capture-owned content
changes. The permanent-delete request accepts `expected_revision` and enforces `WHERE id = ? AND
user_id = ? AND revision = ?` or its backend-equivalent in the same transaction as child cleanup
and deletion. A stale precondition returns a documented 409/412 conflict without deleting the item;
missing items remain distinct. The operation removes capture-owned children and artifacts but does
not delete linked external Media or Notes. Docs-info advertises exact
`hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the response token and atomic mutation are active.
SQLite/PostgreSQL migration, concurrent mutation/delete, authorization, conflict, cascade, and
diagnostic-privacy behavior are covered.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every Reading item summary/detail exposes a positive monotonic `revision`, and every item-owned change relevant to deletion advances it in SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- [ ] #2 Hard delete atomically requires the authenticated user's exact `expected_revision`; stale requests return a documented conflict and remove nothing.
- [ ] #3 Confirmed hard delete removes the Reading item and capture-owned children/artifacts without deleting linked external Media or Notes.
- [ ] #4 Schema migration, concurrent mutation/delete, wrong-user, missing-item, rollback, and cascade behavior have focused SQLite/PostgreSQL regression coverage.
- [ ] #5 Docs-info advertises `hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the complete contract is active, and public API documentation describes the precondition and responses.
- [ ] #6 A new or applicable Server ADR records the schema, destructive precondition, and ownership decision before implementation begins.
- [ ] #7 Late or crashed artifact writers cannot create untracked files after cleanup; cleanup verifies the owning storage namespace and filesystem exclusion before treating absence as success.
- [ ] #8 Legitimate legacy manual and older archives have a documented dry-run-first reconciliation path with unchanged-record checks and no deletion.
- [ ] #9 Optimistic-delete capability defaults false when readiness is unknown or unavailable, and direct hard-delete requests independently reject unavailable target stores without mutation.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
ADR required: yes; ADR path: backlog/decisions/003-reading-atomic-hard-delete.md (existing contract). Continue approved Docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-reading-output-file-reservations.md inline on draft PR 2903. Task 4b protected generic ID/title/HEAD lookup checkpoint implemented and reviewed: DB-owned current-row snapshots under verified storage exclusion, non-creating root resolution, strict namespace/ownership/publication evidence, descriptor-relative open, preserved inactive HTTP behavior and cancellation cleanup. Final targeted verification: 97 descriptor/SQLite route cases in 54.12s, 57 existing generic/managed-output regressions in 98.69s, and 60 required PostgreSQL cases in 307.48s (214 distinct passes, no required-backend skips); exact commands/logs in plan checkpoint. Service/new-test Ruff and Black, scoped DB Black, compile/diff and scoped Bandit pass; DB nine and endpoint one pre-existing Ruff findings unchanged by code/message. Independent review findings addressed with RED/GREEN regressions for malformed witness identity and metadata-error descriptor cleanup. Next: Task 4c Watchlist download/content-loader and sidecar audit/migration; do not claim all Task 4 complete. No activation/background registration/full sweep/Docker provisioning/merge; task In Progress and full-task AC unchecked. PR remains draft; human-written Change summary gate pending.
