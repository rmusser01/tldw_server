## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a positive, monotonically increasing integer `revision` to persisted Reading items and every
Reading summary/detail response. Every item-owned mutation that can change the user's deletion
decision increments that revision, including metadata/status/tag changes and capture-owned content
changes. The permanent-delete request accepts `expected_revision` and enforces `WHERE id = ? AND
user_id = ? AND revision = ?` or its backend-equivalent in the same transaction as child cleanup
and deletion. A stale precondition returns a documented 409/412 conflict without deleting the item;
missing items remain distinct. The operation removes capture-owned children and artifacts but does
not delete linked external Media or Notes. Docs-info advertises exact
`hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the response token and atomic mutation are active.
SQLite/PostgreSQL migration, concurrent mutation/delete, authorization, conflict, cascade, and
diagnostic-privacy behavior are covered.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every Reading item summary/detail exposes a positive monotonic `revision`, and every item-owned change relevant to deletion advances it in SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- [ ] #2 Hard delete atomically requires the authenticated user's exact `expected_revision`; stale requests return a documented conflict and remove nothing.
- [ ] #3 Confirmed hard delete removes the Reading item and capture-owned children/artifacts without deleting linked external Media or Notes.
- [ ] #4 Schema migration, concurrent mutation/delete, wrong-user, missing-item, rollback, and cascade behavior have focused SQLite/PostgreSQL regression coverage.
- [ ] #5 Docs-info advertises `hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the complete contract is active, and public API documentation describes the precondition and responses.
- [ ] #6 A new or applicable Server ADR records the schema, destructive precondition, and ownership decision before implementation begins.
- [ ] #7 Late or crashed artifact writers cannot create untracked files after cleanup; cleanup verifies the owning storage namespace and filesystem exclusion before treating absence as success.
- [ ] #8 Legitimate legacy manual and older archives have a documented dry-run-first reconciliation path with unchanged-record checks and no deletion.
- [ ] #9 Optimistic-delete capability defaults false when readiness is unknown or unavailable, and direct hard-delete requests independently reject unavailable target stores without mutation.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
ADR required: yes; ADR path: backlog/decisions/003-reading-atomic-hard-delete.md (existing contract). Execute approved Docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-reading-output-file-reservations.md inline, draft PR https://github.com/rmusser01/tldw_server/pull/2903 against dev. Task4a complete as a separately verified foundation: descriptor-owning bounded/offloaded response reuses Starlette HTTP/range helpers and existing cancellation draining, with real generic download compatibility characterization. 37 descriptor cases plus 14 SQLite compatibility and 12 prior completion regressions = 63 local passes; 14 required PostgreSQL compatibility passes = 77 distinct cases, no required-backend skips. Review feedback addressed (failed header setup releases descriptor), constructor OSError and 416 compatibility findings fixed; final Ruff/Black/compile/diff and scoped Bandit clean. Exact commands/logs and limitations recorded in plan. Next Task4b: protected current-row lookup after exclusion; structural namespace and committed-witness validation; generic and Watchlist download/content-loader migration and end-to-end path-reuse races. Preserve characterized inactive HEAD and conditional behavior. No production caller uses the response yet; entire Task4 remains incomplete. No activation/background registration/merge/full sweep; TASK-13153 In Progress and full-task AC unchecked.
