## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a positive, monotonically increasing integer `revision` to persisted Reading items and every
Reading summary/detail response. Every item-owned mutation that can change the user's deletion
decision increments that revision, including metadata/status/tag changes and capture-owned content
changes. The permanent-delete request accepts `expected_revision` and enforces `WHERE id = ? AND
user_id = ? AND revision = ?` or its backend-equivalent in the same transaction as child cleanup
and deletion. A stale precondition returns a documented 409/412 conflict without deleting the item;
missing items remain distinct. The operation removes capture-owned children and artifacts but does
not delete linked external Media or Notes. Docs-info advertises exact
`hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the response token and atomic mutation are active.
SQLite/PostgreSQL migration, concurrent mutation/delete, authorization, conflict, cascade, and
diagnostic-privacy behavior are covered.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every Reading item summary/detail exposes a positive monotonic `revision`, and every item-owned change relevant to deletion advances it in SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- [ ] #2 Hard delete atomically requires the authenticated user's exact `expected_revision`; stale requests return a documented conflict and remove nothing.
- [ ] #3 Confirmed hard delete removes the Reading item and capture-owned children/artifacts without deleting linked external Media or Notes.
- [ ] #4 Schema migration, concurrent mutation/delete, wrong-user, missing-item, rollback, and cascade behavior have focused SQLite/PostgreSQL regression coverage.
- [ ] #5 Docs-info advertises `hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the complete contract is active, and public API documentation describes the precondition and responses.
- [ ] #6 A new or applicable Server ADR records the schema, destructive precondition, and ownership decision before implementation begins.
- [ ] #7 Late or crashed artifact writers cannot create untracked files after cleanup; cleanup verifies the owning storage namespace and filesystem exclusion before treating absence as success.
- [ ] #8 Legitimate legacy manual and older archives have a documented dry-run-first reconciliation path with unchanged-record checks and no deletion.
- [ ] #9 Optimistic-delete capability defaults false when readiness is unknown or unavailable, and direct hard-delete requests independently reject unavailable target stores without mutation.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
ADR required: yes; existing backlog/decisions/003-reading-atomic-hard-delete.md governs revisions, ownership and cleanup. Approved spec/plan in Docs/superpowers. Internal item deletion committed as 6862a9caab. Current owned-output DB deletion checkpoint complete and verified: shared exact-output-ID disposal helper, transactional soft/hard deletion, matching archive-reference/FTS cleanup and one parent revision; soft ownership retained, hard file disposal durable. Bulk service delegates unique IDs with actual counts and user-scope check; DB retention purge rechecks expiry/grace under the clock. Quota accounting preserved and measured outside transactions; comparison tests justified a narrower safety-approved delegation change, leaving legacy quota helper definitions unchanged. Verification: 218 combined SQLite regression passes, 20 real PostgreSQL output cases, 4 additional SQLite/PostgreSQL grace cases; 242 distinct targeted passes, no PostgreSQL skips or Docker startup/full sweep. Scoped Bandit zero; formatting/compilation/test lint pass; 10 baseline production Ruff findings unchanged. Read-only review clear. Next: file-first API handlers/scheduler and managed file-option semantics, collection-link writers, legacy reconciliation, production archive routing, coherent DTOs and startup readiness. Capability absent; task remains In Progress.
