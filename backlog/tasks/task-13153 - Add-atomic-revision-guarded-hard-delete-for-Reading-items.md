## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a positive, monotonically increasing integer `revision` to persisted Reading items and every
Reading summary/detail response. Every item-owned mutation that can change the user's deletion
decision increments that revision, including metadata/status/tag changes and capture-owned content
changes. The permanent-delete request accepts `expected_revision` and enforces `WHERE id = ? AND
user_id = ? AND revision = ?` or its backend-equivalent in the same transaction as child cleanup
and deletion. A stale precondition returns a documented 409/412 conflict without deleting the item;
missing items remain distinct. The operation removes capture-owned children and artifacts but does
not delete linked external Media or Notes. Docs-info advertises exact
`hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the response token and atomic mutation are active.
SQLite/PostgreSQL migration, concurrent mutation/delete, authorization, conflict, cascade, and
diagnostic-privacy behavior are covered.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Every Reading item summary/detail exposes a positive monotonic `revision`, and every item-owned change relevant to deletion advances it in SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- [ ] #2 Hard delete atomically requires the authenticated user's exact `expected_revision`; stale requests return a documented conflict and remove nothing.
- [ ] #3 Confirmed hard delete removes the Reading item and capture-owned children/artifacts without deleting linked external Media or Notes.
- [ ] #4 Schema migration, concurrent mutation/delete, wrong-user, missing-item, rollback, and cascade behavior have focused SQLite/PostgreSQL regression coverage.
- [ ] #5 Docs-info advertises `hasReadingOptimisticDeletesV1=true` only when the complete contract is active, and public API documentation describes the precondition and responses.
- [ ] #6 A new or applicable Server ADR records the schema, destructive precondition, and ownership decision before implementation begins.
- [ ] #7 Late or crashed artifact writers cannot create untracked files after cleanup; cleanup verifies the owning storage namespace and filesystem exclusion before treating absence as success.
- [ ] #8 Legitimate legacy manual and older archives have a documented dry-run-first reconciliation path with unchanged-record checks and no deletion.
- [ ] #9 Optimistic-delete capability defaults false when readiness is unknown or unavailable, and direct hard-delete requests independently reject unavailable target stores without mutation.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
ADR required: yes; existing ADR-003 amended. User approved durable reservations after three isolated SQLite file-damage probes. Detailed spec: Docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-reading-output-file-reservations-design.md. Covers bounded generic operation journal, per-user storage binding, cross-writer path/row reservations, copy-before-commit, no-clobber publication, identity-checked crash recovery and fail-closed activation. Occupied destinations reject rather than overwrite; missing source rejects physical changes. Initial review resolved uncertain commit acknowledgement, abort witness ordering and source identity. Follow-up user-requested amendments add descriptor-bound reading, fs_done-separated idempotent original-target history delivery, finite byte admission and bounded journal-backed streaming without untracked external scratch. Re-review found and resolved ownership/reader-volume namespace mismatch; required evidence includes same-user two-volume same-filename reads. Final independent review approved with no remaining serious spec issues. Documentation-only verification: git diff --check; no production changes or new runtime test claims. 2207a84fc1 remains the last code checkpoint with 146 targeted passes. Written-spec user approval is required before implementation planning. Capability absent; TASK-13153 In Progress.
