## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Mirror the linked GitHub product-area migration issue. Closure requires zero current product-state baseline exceptions for the owned path map area and the verification gates recorded in the GitHub issue.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The linked GitHub issue owns current count and public status.
- [x] #2 Implementation PR tasks are created under this child when the area is too broad for one PR.
- [ ] #3 Backlog notes record PR links and before/after count evidence.
<!-- AC:END -->
