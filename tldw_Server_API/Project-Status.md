# Embeddings Scale-Out Implementation - Project Status

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Transform the existing synchronous embeddings system into a scalable, distributed architecture capable of handling multiple concurrent users with different service tiers.

**Architecture**: Fan-out queue-based system with specialized worker pools for chunking, embedding generation, and storage operations.

**Timeline**: 8-week implementation across 4 phases

## 🚨 Risk Areas & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Redis Performance**: Monitor queue depths, implement sharding if needed
2. **GPU Memory**: Implement proper model eviction, monitor VRAM usage
3. **ChromaDB Scaling**: Test with large collections, implement partitioning

### Operational Risks  
1. **Data Migration**: Thorough backup procedures, staged rollout
2. **Worker Failures**: Comprehensive retry logic, circuit breakers
3. **Queue Backlog**: Auto-scaling implementation, alerting thresholds
